I had to take my wife to a doctor’s appointment today. As is typical, there was a lot of hurry up and wait. I had both my work laptop and iPad with me. The iPad is a Verizon LTE model, which means they throw in the mobile hotspot capability for no extra charge. Hadn’t used it yet so I figured I’d give it a whirl to see how painful the process could be, just for future reference.

Turned the hotspot on on the iPad. Connected the laptop to the appropriate network name. And it just worked! I was even pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness of the network. Didn’t feel cellular at all.

Good to know, especially when routing around ridiculous hotel rates for Wi-Fi.
