Another [Premiership][1] Saturday has come and gone. After the first month we're starting to get a little insight.

Manchester United is looking pretty good. Then again Chelsea started out with 6 straight wins last year. Not that the Blues completely collapsed, or that I'd bet against the the Red Devils, but it's a long season.

Chicarito is a bad dude.

Sheik Mansour is getting his money's worth out of the Man City club. And Carlos Tevez just hit the pitch for his first match.

Maybe it's just Fox Soccer Channel house style, but I don't like how after halftime the announcers don't reset who's on the pitch.

Premier League games are a welcome replacement for the early NCAA talk shows. That'll probably work well for the NFL yakfests as well. The matches are great because they move at a good pace, no commercial interruptions, and they finish within 2 hours.
