Title: Streaking 2

In an homage to [days gone by][1], let’s see if I can run the table
posting every day for May 2022.

I actually had a good time last week fooling around with the Python
based [xonsh][2] shell. Way too much time was spent getting the [conch
emoji][3] (🐚) into the shell prompt but most of the blame can be laid at
the feet of the [powerline2][4] plugin. Hooking into the prompt
generation isn’t obvious unless you’re already familiar with the
powerline model which has been transported from the vi world. Not my jam.

There’s definitely something enticing about having Python closely
coupled with the shell CLI. I need to get it installed on a few more
machines and used more frequently to have a real assessment. I’m
waiting to see where the real warts are but so far, so good.
