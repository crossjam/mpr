*"Most people realize the Hawks are the better team, but Philly is showing a lot of grit. At the end of the day, their goaltending might finally bite them in the ass."*

**Congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks, the 2010 Stanley Cup Champions.** This means in the past 25 years the city of Chicago has held the [Lombardi Trophy][3] (once), the [Stanley Cup][2] (once), the [O'Brien Trophy][4] (six times) and the [Commissioner's Trophy][1] (once). Take that New York *(Knicks waiting since '72)* and LA *(Los Angeles Kings working on their first cup)*, not to mention Philly *(Eagles have yet to win a Super Bowl)*.

*"If the Lakers can make a couple of adjustments to slow Allen down, without giving up a lot to Paul Pierce and/or Rando, they can get one or two in Boston."*

Still sticking with Lakers in 7.
