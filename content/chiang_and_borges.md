Title: Chiang and Borges

Having just completed a collection of Borges short stories, [_The
Aleph and Other Stories_][2], I recently had a lightbulb moment. The
brilliance of Ted Chiang’s short story [_Exhalation_][1] (thank you
Wayback Machine) partially derives from channeling Borges
so much. Deeply philosophical, first person narrative, brutally
compact, with a mind bending twist at the end.

Both authors highly recommended.
