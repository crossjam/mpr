O’Reilly Media has a [pre-release version of a book on graph database technology][1]:
> Graph Databases, published by O’Reilly Media, discusses the problems that are well aligned with graph databases, with examples drawn from practical, real-world use cases. This book also looks at the ecosystem of complementary technologies, highlighting what differentiates graph databases from other database technologies, both relational and NOSQL.

> Graph Databases is written by Ian Robinson, Jim Webber, and Emil Eifrém, graph experts and enthusiasts at Neo Technology, creators of Neo4j, the world’s leading graph database.

I’ll probably eventually pick up a copy, but I’m waiting for it to bake a little bit. Also wondering if it’s mainly going to be a promotional for [Neo4j][2].
