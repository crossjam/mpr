An [interesting, contrarian perspective][1] from Lucas Gonze:
> News stories about copyright often pop up in the technology press. The subtext is usually like: “here’s how deeply broken copyright is.”

> Don’t believe the subtext. Copyright is not broken in any sense that matters.

> Copyright is in the process of adapting to changes in information technology. The process of adapting will take a longish time. The process started in the 1980s, which led to passage of landmark legislation such as the DMCA in the 1990s. In the years 2000-2010 the DMCA safe harbors were tested and defined in detail, and internet sites went from flat defiance of the law to grudging compliance. That’s 25 years of progress. I imagine 25 more will complete the job.

The notion is also applicable to other domains that typically frustrate technologists. I’m looking at you healthcare, even though you can make a good argument that health payment is broken in many senses that matter.
