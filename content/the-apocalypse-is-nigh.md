[Google Reader, dead July 1, 2013.][1] Victim of another Google Spring Cleaning.

> We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months.

As a feedaholic from the earliest days, this’ll be the end of an era. But maybe it’s the extinction event that will spur a new round of innovation with RSS. I’d do a Munch like Scream, but everyone knew this was coming.

I would like to **heartily thank the GReader team** for a boatload of utility over the years.
