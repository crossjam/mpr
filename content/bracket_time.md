Maryland lost in the conference tourney semis, while Cal and Georgetown at least made it to their conference finals. Both finals were thrillers, but the Bears and Hoyas ultimately lost.

Had to sweat Cal for a bit. Man were the TV experts ragging on the Pac-10 this year. But I couldn't see four Mountain West teams and only one Pac-10 team.

The NCAA tourney used to be at the top of my sporting event list although it's fallen off as the college game has changed over the years. However, I still get up for that first weekend.
