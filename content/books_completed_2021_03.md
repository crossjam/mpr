Slowed down a bit in July, but with four books completed this month
plus [the honorably included][5], that’s six more added to the
tally. Nineteen down for 2021.

* [_The Game of our Lives_][1], David Goldblatt
* [_Done Deal_][2], Daniel Geey
* [_The Effective Manager_][3], Mark Horstman
* [_The Turing Test_][4], Chris Beckett

I respect the writing quality of _The Turing Test_ and indeed, quite a few of
the stories were thought provoking: _The Turing Test (eponymous short story)_,
_La Maccina_, _The Gates of Troy_, _Piccadilly Circus_, _Karel’s
Prayer_. However, Beckett’s style didn’t really resonate with me.

_The Game of Our Lives_ places English football in a larger and wider social
context, especially in times before the Premier League.

_The Effective Manager_ is exceedingly prescriptive, which may or may not be
what one needs. Definitely useful at this point in my career.

_Done Deal_ was a pretty mundane explainer for me. A few bits of transfer policy
detail were enlightening.
