I don’t know how I missed [Craig Kerstiens’ post on *upserts* in PostgreSQL 9.5][1], but I’m glad they’re here.

> If you’ve followed anything I’ve written about Postgres, you know that I’m a fan. At the same time you know that there’s been one feature that so many other databases have, which Postgres lacks and it causes a huge amount of angst for not being in Postgres… Upsert. Well the day has come, it’s finally committed and will be available in Postgres 9.5.
