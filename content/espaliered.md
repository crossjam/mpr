**espalier** |iˈspalyər; -yā| *noun*

* a fruit tree or ornamental shrub whose branches are trained to grow flat against a wall, supported on a lattice or a framework of stakes.

* a lattice or framework of this type.

*verb* [ trans. ]

train (a tree or shrub) in such a way.

Ran across this one reading Margaret Atwood's [*Oryx and Crake*][1]. I don't think I've seen that word **EVER** in my life, until today.
