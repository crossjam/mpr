Unfortunately, it was only the last few weekends of the league. Chelsea had pretty much locked up the title although Manchester United was mildly threatening.

Well, the Premier League's back. Kick-off for the 2010-11 season is tomorrow. I'm sort of stoked to follow an entire campaign, end-to-end. The tricky bit is choosing a side to root for. [ManU][2] would feel a bit like rooting for the New York Yankees and [Chelsea][3] would just be front running. Sort of tempted to go with [The Gunners][4].
