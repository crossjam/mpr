In the spirit of Jeff Atwood's [*Meta is Murder*][1], I've generally been avoiding meta-blogging here. Not that I'm generating a stream of the most deepest, insightful posts, but hey it's my site.

However, allow an indulgence.

Recently I hit a couple of century marks in my posting. First, in March, April, and May of 2010, I posted a total of 100 times. That beats my previous best three month total of 96 from September, August, and July of 2009.

Second, I'm currently on a streak of 107 straight days of posting. I hit 100 straight on June 6th and have been trucking along ever since. There have been a couple of close calls and challenges, mostly related to long days at work, late night post-work social functions, and long distance work related travel. *Did I thoroughly blame work?* Posting desperation only really crept in one time, but I beat midnight with five minutes or so to spare. And only [one post][5] felt like it was mailed in. Otherwise, I've felt like I've made a good honest effort to provide some value or entertainment with a basis in the myriad of things that I'm working on or interest me on a daily basis. I'll probably take a break soon though.

One thing the streak has done is bring some clarity to this blog's themes. Clearly, I'm not close to what I long ago wrote in the [About][2] page. The #1 topic has to be a trailing edge geek's [quest for a new smartphone][3]. Then it's equal parts, [post-disco dance/electronic music][4], Apple nuggets, sports observations, and a skoosh of science fiction. *Mmmmm, fantasy football's only 3 months away!*

Some stuff I need to get back to? Working on a sideline programming project. Reading more books. And expanding my library of DnB mixes.

No plans to do comments, as I still can't stand them. But *Annals of the Disco Diaspora* might get some more play. I'm having fun digging into my mental history of 80's and 90's dance music.
