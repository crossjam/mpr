<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/About This Mac Snap.png" alt="About This Mac Snap.png" border="0" width="160" height="182" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" /> This past week marked the anniversaries of [starting this blog][1] and [getting the MacBook][2] I'm writing this post on.

Unlike [the last anniversary][3], I don't have much to say this time around. I've been on a nice continuous posting roll that I'm quite happy with. It'd be nice to post more about tech, but the current mix is fulfilling.

Probably the most surprising thing is how well the MacBook has held up. It's pretty close to three generations old at this point and was bottom of the line for its time. Other than the bus speed, *3x now*, and the graphics chip, *NVIDIA instead of Intel*, the specs are comparable with what Apple is currently selling.

Despite only having 4Gb of main memory, I comfortably keep 13-16 applications open simultaneously. This includes three browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) holding lots of open tabs. With the continuous subtle improvement of Mac OS X, it feels like the overall experience is getting better. The machine rarely feels slow and never crashes.

Conclusions are upcoming. The streak will end in the next few weeks. And there will be a smartphone purchase by the end of September.

*Onward and upward!*
