One new piece of kit in my tech toolbox is the [Caddy][1] web server. Small, self-contained, and full featured, it definitely comes in handy for personal tech projects and professional prototypes. Biggest win is that it **automatically** handles HTTPS certificates through LetsEncrypt. As in, you just put the domain name in the config file and HTTPS cert management is solved.

Brilliant!
