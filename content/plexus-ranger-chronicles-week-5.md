The beat goes on. Lose, win big, lose, win big, lose. And of course Julio Jones adds to the injury streak, going down with, you guessed it, a bad hammy.

About the best that can be said for this past week is that I had my optimal lineup in. Of course my bench was fully parked with Must Start level guys on bye. Makes filling out the lineup card easy.

Did have a little hope, holding a lead going into Monday Night Football. But when the opponent has Matthew Stafford **and** Calvin Johnson… it was over mercifully quick.

Still 9 games left, and only a game out of the last playoff spot. A-Listers back in the lineup in a big way. Every streak starts with one win.
