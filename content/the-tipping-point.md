I’ve been holding out on new traditional home computing gear *(e.g. laptop or desktop)* since I really haven’t had a good need, despite [my lust][1] for the finer things. I’ve even gone so far as to [jack-up the hard drives in Ye Olde MacBook][2] to good effect. Such good effect that it could easily be my primary personal laptop for at least another year and a half. I mean really, if MS Office 2011 runs decently on this old kit, what more can you ask for?

Except for that pesky desire to run virtual machines. I picked up a copy of [Parallels Desktop][3] in a recent MacUpdate promotion. Then I wanted to start kicking around some Hadoop virtual machines from vendors like Cloudera and Hortonworks. Guess what? You really need a free and clear 4GB of RAM to get started with these vms. My poor old machine only has 4GB **total**.

So Ye Olde MacBook is fine for the standard Ubuntu or CentOS distro, but the heavy duty data sciency type stuff is probably beyond it’s meager capabilities.

Something to chew on.
