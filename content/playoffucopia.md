[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/NBA Logo Small.png" alt="NBA Logo Small.png" border="0" width="50" height="114" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />](htp://www.nba.com/) It's been a pretty full buffet of NBA playoff action the past couple of days.  Thursday and Friday showcased three games. This weekend we got four games on Saturday and four more on Sunday. The only downside for me is that most of the good games have been the Western Conference late nighters. I'm an early riser these days, so typically don't make it past the first quarter, if that, of those games.

Some quick observations:

* Thought Miami was going to give the Celtics some trouble, but the C's have demonstrated much better winnin' time experience.

* The Lakers are in a little bit of trouble. A couple of bad bounces here or there, or an inconvenient injury, and they could be put out by the OKC Thunder. Kevin Durant, The Slim Assassin (TM).

* I don't know how the Utah Jazz are doing it against the Denver Nuggets. George Karl taking a leave for cancer treatment seems to have really put the Nuggets off kilter. Going into the playoffs I thought Denver was the only team with a chance to take out the Lakers. Now I'm not so sure about either the Lakers or the Nuggets.

* Suns vs Trail Blazers seems like the most fun series going.

* The Bulls just don't have the talent to stay with the Cavs. Hope that free agent thing works out for the Bulls this off season.

Oh, and living near the nation's capital I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Stanley Cup playoffs. [Rock the Red!][2] Ovechkin and the Capitals are stringing out this series with the Canadiens a little longer than necessary, but I'm pretty sure they'll get the job done. I stupidly dipped out of yesterday's [Chicago/Nashville game][1], right after Hossa got his penalty, thinking the game was over.
