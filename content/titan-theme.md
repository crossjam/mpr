<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://crossjam.net/wp/mpr/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/MPR-Titan-Header.png" alt="MPR Titan Header" border="0" width="325" height="83" style="margin: 10px;"/></div> When I converted this blog to WordPress, I looked at a number of themes, finally settling on [Blogum][3]. I was never really happy with it though. The title banner was never quite right. While a nice and clean design, the main body font didn't suit me.

I ran across Mickey Petersen's survey of [new features in Emacs 24][2]. The theme he was using, [Titan from The Theme Foundry][1], looked good to me. So I decided to give it a whirl here. That's one of the really nice features of WordPress, the ease with which new themes can be installed and experimented with.

Titan looks good to me, so I'll be keeping it around. I'll probably even ante up for pro support.
