Six Apart has pretty much [swirled down the drain][1]. While I managed to successfully shift from [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org/) 4.x to 5.x, it [wasn't a whole lot of fun][3]. Development seems to be [stagnating][2] a bit. Might be time to switch to a new blogging platform.

The only problem is that the options are pretty limited. [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) would be the obvious frontrunner, but I'm really not into maintaining anything based upon Php. Plus, I'd need to figure out how to import all my old content. Could switch to [Posterous](http://posterous.com/), but I really like hosting my own site and using [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/).

After WordPress, everything else seems marginalized, although maybe I need open my aperture.

*Sigh.*
