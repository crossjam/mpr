Flew [Virgin Airways][1] on Tuesday. Have to say the experience didn’t match the hype. The plane had lots of shiny and rounded accents, but other than that, just about like every other airline. Maybe a little more legroom in Coach.

Was amused when the in-flight entertainment and food ordering system crashed. Then it went through a Linux reboot. I might have been the only person who enjoyed reading the boot log as it flew by.
