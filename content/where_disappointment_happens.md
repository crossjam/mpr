This may arguably be one of the worst National Basketball Association postseasons in recent memory. To wit:

* Earlier in the season, I thought the Denver Nuggets might be the only team that could take out the Lakers. Then they lost George Karl. Then they went out to the Jazz in 6 uninspired, undisciplined games.

* Oklahoma City, the most exciting young team in the league, failed to force a game seven against the champion Lakers.

* The Dallas Mavericks at least looked like a contender. With Caron Butler and Brendan Haywood they seemed a little tougher. They reverted to their typical soft form and went down in 6 to the ancient Spurs.

* There was only one game 7 in the first round. A scintillating matchup of Atlanta vs Milwaukee. In that series, Atlanta managed to get blown out on the road multiple times and lose game 5 at home.

* The conference semi-finals featured 3 sweeps. The team of the league MVP, and the best regular season record, was ousted in 6 games including an inexplicable home blowout in a "must win" game 5. The Cavaliers basically gave up with a minute to go and down less than 10 in game 6. Now all we're left with is a frenzy of LeBron free agency speculation.

* There have been 4 sweeps total and two 5 game series. Half of the 12 series this year have been complete mismatches.

* I may be wrong about this, but there have been no overtime games so far. If there have been, they weren't all that memorable.

To top it all off the favorites in the conference finals, Los Angeles and Orlando, are prohibitive. The Lakers have way too much size for the Suns. Boston might give Orlando a challenge, but the Magic are hot and have beaten the Celtics three out of four times this year. If form holds, we get a rematch of last years finals, with essentially the same rosters. Okay Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ron Artest might stir things up a little, but I wouldn't predict a different outcome.

Yawn!! Jeez, the Bulls vs Celtics series last year had more excitement than this year's playoff games **combined**. My only real rooting interest now is to see Steve Nash in the finals.

*The NBA, where disappointment happens.*
