Title: Dragged Into GitHub Actions

Thanks to Simon Willison’s [`click-app` cookiecutter template][2] I’ve
been sucked into [GitHub actions][1]. His cookiecutter has Python
testing baked in and GH Actions that leverage that testing turned on
by default. Normally I wouldn’t care, but the repo workflow sends you
email **and** can badge itself as red when failing, which annoys me
enough that I have to go fix it.

Not at all bad though to get introduced to GH Actions since they seem
to be core knowledge for good GH citizenship. Just takes some getting
used to while being part of [a GitLab CI/CD][3] shop as part of the
day job.
