Well, [that was fun][1].

Started back to full employment this past Monday. The onboarding has been painless so far, even to the point of my personally designed [Uplift][2] standing desk being already assembled when I walked in the door.

Obviously a long way to go, but the commute reduction is feeling like a ridiculous win. Plus the team I joined is really even keel, low drama, and generally **quiet** in the open space lab we occupy, when there are actually people there. *About half the company is remote.* Sure, I’d love an office with a door, but sometimes you gotta live with the tradeoffs.

More to come ...
