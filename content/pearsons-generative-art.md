I've been looking for that ["processing"][3] book that really gets into the craft of generative art. I already know how to program, I'm looking for insight into the artistic process. The following reviewer quote gives me hope:

> *Matt’s approach is unique in that he focuses on core concepts of genart instead of core concepts of programming. He succeeds in teaching about variables, functions, OOP and recursion without the reader realising what he’s doing.*

The artwork thumbnails look beautiful as well.

On the other hand, I've already got a few processing books gathering dust on my bookshelf, so why should  keep banging my head against this wall.
