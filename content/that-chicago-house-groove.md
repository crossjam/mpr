The premise of Michaelangelo Matos’ [*“How Chicago house got its groove back”*][1] might be a bit flawed, but I found it worth a read. Feels like Matos at least did quite a bit of interviewing and background research, including talking to folks like DJ Sneak, Derrick Carter, and Cajmere in depth. If accurate, it fills in some details of mid-90’s House music I wasn’t aware of.

The comments are somewhat illuminating as well, with Carter himself chiming in with some corrections and lamentations. Writing such a piece is always fraught, partially due to the obscurity of what’s trying to be covered making it hard to get the story right, partially because space limitations mean leaving out part of the story, and partially because there are always irate fans who know better.

**Ob. disclosure.** When Matos’ mentions Curtis A. Jones forsaking graduate school in Chemical Engineering, I was literally there with Cajmere at UC Berkeley. Part of a small cohort of black engineering students, we met at a College of Engineering function and started hitting the SF scene for parties. There's brushes with greatness, but I can definitely say, *“I knew him when…”*.

*Hat tip, [@CajualRecords][3]*

**P.S.** As [predicted][2], DJ Sneak’s, *Fabric 62*, didn’t do a whole lot for me. This is why I have a bit of a problem with the notion that Sneak somehow led a revival in Chicago House Music.
