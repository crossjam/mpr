[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/iPod Touch.jpg" alt="iPod Touch.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="101" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] My better half got me an [iPod Touch][1] for my birthday. Just fired it up, tweaked a few of the settings, and managed to send a couple of e-mails. Don't have a ton to report, although getting used to the keyboard will take some doing. I'm currently befuddled by cursor navigation in text fields. **Update**: Looks like text navigation is covered in an [iPhone How-To][4].

At 64 gigabytes of storage the Touch can hold all of my music library with plenty of room to spare. I'll still carry [my trusty iPod Nano][3], but now I have to figure out what to put on it. I think I'll make it a repository for smart and shuffled playlists.

As a middle-aged computer scientist, it's amazing that we've gone from about zero to ten times the original [Xerox PARCTAB][2] in under 20 years. We overestimate technological change in the short term, and underestimate the impact in the long term.
