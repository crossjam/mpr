Over the years, I've built a bunch of command line oriented Python scripts. Logging has always been a big tool in the box but I've never done as much profiling as I would have liked. So the [pyCLI][1] module looks pretty interesting:

> *The cli package is a framework for making simple, correct command line applications in Python. With cli, you can quickly add standard command line parsing; logging; unit and functional testing; and profiling to your CLI apps. To make it easier to do the right thing, cli wraps all of these tools into a single, consistent application interface.*

If it does what it says on the tin, pyCLI can eliminate a lot of boilerplate. I'm also interested in the background of who put the module together and whether it's been used in a production system. Otherwise, it looks pretty well designed and put together.
