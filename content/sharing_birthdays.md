[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Migrant Mother.jpg" alt="Migrant Mother.jpg" border="0" width="195" height="240" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] I've long known I share my birthday with [John Wayne][2]. Can't say I'm particularly a fan of his movies or some of his politics. I don't think I've watched a single Wayne film.

[Via the Flickr blog][3], I learned that [Dorothea Lange][4] was also born on May 26th. Now there's someone I'm happy to share birthdays with, especially since some of her best work is preserved at Cal Berkeley's Bancroft Library. I did my graduate work at Cal, and while not a raving Old Blue, I'm quite proud of my alma mater.

And it turns out that a number of Lange's photos are out of copyright, so some digital versions are freely available from Flickr, including the unretouched original ["Migrant Mother"][5] shot to your left.
