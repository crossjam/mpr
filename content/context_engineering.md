[Simon Willison noted][1] an AI related neologism _"context
engineering"_, emerging on The Socials (TM).

I used to scoff at the term prompt engineering. Its early connotation
was one of messing around with text prompts in an ad hoc fashion and
seeing what happens. Adding goofy stuff like "my grandmother’s life
depends on you getting this answer correct." Not much engineering involved.

Given the explosion in the maximum size of context windows and how
they’re constructed impacts LLM performance, I’m now in the camp of
prompt engineering is serious business. In my head, I was noodling
with a term _"context programming"_ to express the many ways that
crafting contexts for LLMs have arisen in engineering
practice. C. f. [DSPy][2]. There’s also a bit of science emerging
around where and how models interact with large contexts.

If _"context engineering"_ catches on, I’m good with it.
