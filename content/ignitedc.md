Oh well!

The [Ignite presentation format](http://www.ignite-dc.com/about) consists of strictly timed and advanced slide (read PowerPoint) presentations. The concept was born in Japan as [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org), adopted by techies and other hipsters in the states, and renamed due to copyright issues.

I've [known about Pecha Kucha/Ignite events](http://crossjam.net/nmh/archives/001407.html) for years, but haven't had an opportunity to attend one. Hopefully, keeping a closer eye on a local version will eliminate this lack.
