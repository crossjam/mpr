[Previously][4], I had posted about the [pyCLI][1] package, mostly just stashing the link away. Recently I've had occasion to put the module to use for real and started digging into the docs.

Better. Than. Remembered.

The argument parsing really easy and convenient. I am now salivating about the [logging][2] and [daemonizing][3] features. pyCLI doesn't do anything spectacular, but it makes a couple of good to do things, easy to do.
