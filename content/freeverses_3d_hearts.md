That might have been a mistake. Talk about a big time sink.

I can't say I'm particularly blown away, but it's a nicely polished product. You can play against a handful of odd characters each with uniquely humorous dialog. Then again there's not a whole lot you can do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts">the game of Hearts</a>.

It's about the best version of Hearts I found for the Mac, given a limited web search. There's probably a comparable free version, but for $20 I didn't have to think too hard.
