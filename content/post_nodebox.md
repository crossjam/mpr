While I'm not really looking to pick up a new tool, especially since I don't really know the one I've got, I keep an eye out on happenings in the space.

The NodeBox folks are [threatening][3] to release [NodeBox 2, a.k.a. Gravital][2], real soon now. Looks like it will use Jython for cross-platform support and a performance speedup. On the one one hand, speedups and access to lots of Java libraries (ala [processing](http://processing.org)) is a good thing. On the other hand, the loss of numpy and its multidimensional array capabilities is a downer. Plus, Jython lags Cython a bit in language features.

Then there's [Field][5], essentially Gravital except it's here now and it's focused on [live coding][6]. Looks like it has pretty sophisticated audio and music capabilities. I'll also have to snoop around and see what low level pixel pushing features it has.
