While I had a 100% completion rate, that's not saying much when you only start one book.

* [*Rainbows End*][1]. Vernor Vinge. An interesting and fairly entertaining  vision of a technology infused future. Not a homerun, but a nice solid double.

Excuses? The wife was out of town for a big part of one week, leaving me on toddler duty. While I finished [*Rainbows End*][1] during the stretch, I was sapped of momentum. Then we had two trips, to Cocoa Beach and Chicago, which usually means lots of reading time. Said toddler was a member of the traveling party though, wiping out most spare reading opportunities and energy. Plus I'm not particularly excited about the current reading choices at hand.

Will have some work to do to meet my goal of 35 this year.
