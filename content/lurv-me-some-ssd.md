I replaced it’s 320 Gb spinning disk hard drive, with a [500 Gb version of the Samsung SSD][1] pictured to the right. 

The thing is way overkill, with a 6 Gb / sec transfer rate on a bus that can only do 1.5 Gb / sec tops. But lordy’, has it made my measly old 4 Gb RAM laptop feel usable. Recently it had been pretty neglected, grinding to a halt when I had both Chrome and Firefox open with a bunch of tabs. Now it feels great with nary a pause or spinning beach ball. A larger sample size is needed, but if this keeps up, the machine may rise again to prime blogging platform.

Next up, I need to deconstruct the machine’s innards, replace the Apple issued SuperDrive with an [OptiBay][2], and put 1Tb of spinning platters inside. That should do the trick for at least a year or two.

**Update**. But I’m also feeling the lack of the Retina display. To be continued.
