So I did something I've infrequently had opportunity for over the past few years. I rented a movie.

Actually, it wasn't much of a rental. Since I'm an [Amazon Prime][1] subscriber, Amazon graced me with a free streaming access to a number of  videos through its [Instant Video][2] service. So I gave it a test drive with Guy Ritchie's movie, [*Revolver*][3], a surprisingly psychological gangster film.

Overall, the experience was pretty good, although not great. I watched it on my laptop over Wi-Fi, with Verizon Fios as the backhaul. There were only the occasional drop outs and stutters. And I paused and resumed with no ill effect multiple times.

This brought to mind the slew of options I now have to get digital content including:

* The aforementioned Amazon Instant Video
* [HBOGo][4], which is offered through Verizon. Had a few glitches the couple of times I've tried it, but where else am I gonna get every episode of [*Curb Your Enthusiasm*][6] for free?
* The [iTunes Store][5], which I've used to good effect for nomadic content fixes
* And [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/), who seems to hit me with a new promotion every other month or so since I'm a former subscriber

Not to mention other services like [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/) which I haven't even bothered to stay informed about. 

There's a burgeoning groundswell of "cordcutting" to get rid of cable/dish through such Internet services. For me, they're not quite easy enough to deal with *(or more accurately train up my wife)*, and I'm a serious sports junkie. It's just easier to pay the monopolists and graze the live broadcast sports buffet.
