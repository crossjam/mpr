* **DJ Marky**, [*FabricLive.55*][1]. An interesting mix of DnB and other stuff from a Brazilian prodigy. Probably worth repeated listening
* **Noisia**, [*FabricLive.40*][2]. On first listen, not danceable enough for me. Every time the beat gets going, the mix turns all bleep, bloopy. Probably not due for heavy rotation.
* **Marcus Intalex**, [*FabricLive.35*][3]. DnB with a somber bent. Likely to get more listens.
* **Mastercuts**, [*Classic Salsoul, Volume 1*][4]. An oldie, but expensive, goodie that I just sprung for used. Worth it just for First Choice's *Let No Man Put Asunder*.
* **Pete Tong and Felix Da Housecat**, [*All Gone Ibiza, 11*][5]. Only listened to the Felix Da Housecat disc, which had a solid, old time Chicago House feel.
* **DJ Heather**, [*Tangerine*][6]. On deck. Can't wait to hear one of my favorite dj's earliest commercial releases.

I bought half of these as used CDs from the Amazon Marketplace since there was no digital media purchase option. Worked out pretty well. Despite having to pay standard shipping, since these aren't covered by my Amazon Prime, they were all still pretty cheap. And it all arrived within 5 business days of my order.
