Four completed in the shortest month, February, is nothing to sneeze
at. Seven total for the year. Thoughts after the break.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

_Football’s Secret Trade_ is an interesting look at the international
soccer transfer market. Lots of money flowing through an opaque system
leads to lots of questions. Unfortunately, the book never quite found
a coherent set of storylines or characters, although the Athletico
Madrid angle almost became a good spine to hang everything off of.

_How to Decide_ is definitely more of a workbook than a reading book,
maybe designed to support Duke’s seminars. It doesn’t make
particularly good reading via Amazon Kindle, but still very
worthwhile. Love the three attributes of a proper tool for a job
(paraphrasing):

* use that can be reliably repeated
* proper usage can be taught to someone else to consistently achieve
  the assigned task
* usage can be examined and assessed for correctness, both by the task
  executor and others
  
Many of the processes used to make decisions do not qualify as good tools.


_Tor!_ is just a fun, opinionated history of German
soccer. Unsusprisingly, there’s a lot of national angst even for a
country that has regularly reached the pinnacle on the world
stage. But at least I got schooled on how those odd looking club names
were constructed.

I’ll assume the Nigerian influence in _Rosewater_ is authentic, which
makes this a quite interesting alien invasion tale. Have to say, every
possible squeam inducing variation of fluid makes an appearance, but
is in keeping with the title. I think this is what the author
intended, but the lead character, Kaaro, is totally reprehensible, but
at the same time fairly compelling.
