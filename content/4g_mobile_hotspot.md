[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Sierra Overdrive.jpg" alt="Sierra Overdrive.jpg" border="0" width="125" height="94" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1]Macworld has [an in-depth review][1] of Sierra Wireless's Overdrive mobile 4G hotspot. It's the [Mi-Fi][2] for 4G. Apparently, it's not a performance win for devices such as the iPhone or iPad that have their own 3G radio built-in. Seems to work great though for laptops. The review is actually a pretty good match for my use-case.

But if a [smartphone][3] can serve the same purpose, with the same performance, that's one less device to carry. The only upside is that the mobile hotspot might have better battery life.
