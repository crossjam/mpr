By my math, I went 29 for 31 on daily posts last month. I was hoping
to [run the table][1] after a long period of infrequent, intermittent
posting. There’s a certain symmetry in how I screwed up right at the
beginning of the month and right at the end of the month, but 20+ days
in between is not too bad.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

All that said, I’m going to try and keep this blogging thing rolling
once again. Some things I learned or maybe re-learned:

* The routine is good for the brain and the spirit
* Keeping a few short, easy to update, draft messages as a safety
  valve is good idea
* I have extreme admiration for deep technical bloggers like [Simon
  Willison][2] and [Mark Litwintschik][3]. Expect more like that here.
* But I’ve also come to realize those deep tech posts come from doing
  actual work and take a while to develop
* Much respect as well to podcasters like Tobias Macey, Michael
  Kennedy, Ben Lorica, Jared Santo, and Adam Stacoviak. I will not be
  doing any podcasting. _Damn though. This pool needs some diversification_.
* Writing Markdown in Emacs is enjoyable
* Emoji in Emacs is sort of fun now
* Pelican feels like it should be way more efficient and a lot faster
