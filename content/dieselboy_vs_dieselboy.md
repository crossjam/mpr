I'm starting to think Dieselboy's [*The Human Resource*][2] is better end-to-end than Dieselboy's [*The Dungeonmaster's Guide*][1]. Heresy!

There are no real dead spots in *The Human Resource* and there are plenty of high points. *Parallel Universe* gets the mix jumpin'. *Subculture* breaks up the instrumental flow with some solid rhymes. I always like a dose of vocals in my mixes. Coming out of the downbeat *Barrier Break*, *Reality Check* is explosive. The triple play of *The Rapture*, *Grunge 3* and *The Divide* is just sickness kicking off the **last quarter** of the mix. It's rare when a mix's final five tracks are all over the top high energy, peak cuts.

Yup. I'm revising [my original thoughts on *The Human Resource*][3] and moving it to the front of the Dieselboy oeuvre. Or at least the part I own.
