Recently in my feedflow I’ve noticed quite a few plaudits for [Google+ Hangouts][2], e.g. Lucas Gonze, who I’ve followed for a quite a while, is a [Hangouts fan][1]. While I’ve enjoyed the television commercials, since I’m not a huge G+ user I haven’t really gotten into it. However, I’m intrigued that there might be something that shows a path to elimination of the execrable Microsoft LiveMeeting in the workplace. 

The amount of expensive talent time wasted setting up collaboration with that hideous tool is stunning to me. Feels like Hangouts hits the sweet spot, while being Web native and thus cross platform, which is the other half of my gripe with LiveMeeting, being a Mac user.

Probably not in my career lifetime, but one can hope.
