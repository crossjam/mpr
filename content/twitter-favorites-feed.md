Snagging interesting tweets for later perusal is also easy, as you can mark a tweet in your timeline as a favorite.

However, I now try to do all of my information aggregation in NetNewsWire. So going to a Twitter client to see my favorites is a bit of a pain.

Enter Twitter RSS feeds: <http://twitter.com/favorites/crossjam.rss>

Now I can subscribe to the above link and see my favorites stream along with my inflow. The only downside is that NetNewsWire doesn't auto link the URLs in the tweets. Google Reader is smart enough to do this, but I'm not using GReader on a daily basis. The quick and dirty solution is to pop to the tweet in a browser tab and then follow the, typically shortened, link from there.
