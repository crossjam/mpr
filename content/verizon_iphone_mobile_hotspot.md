So Verizon announced today that they'll be carrying Apple's iPhone, starting in early February. No biggie, looks like almost exactly the same product. Even though DC is the home of Verizon, I feel no urge to switch carriers. Hopefully it'll relieve some pressure on the AT&T network.

But I'm slightly chapped that [the Verizon iPhone is enabled to act as a mobile WI-FI hotspot][1]. Our fine friends overseas have always had this capability, but it's sort of lame AT&T can't turn this on. Point Verizon.

Well at least until they announce their gouging 3G data plans. Still, this might put a little heat on AT&T. [As I said][2], that would make the dang thing pretty close to perfect for me.

**Update:** I was in error about iPhone mobile hotspotting in Europe. Verizon's iPhone is the first appearance of the capability in the Apple product. I was thinking of tethering, which AT&T eventually made available in the US. According to the Boy Genius Report though, [perfection may well be nigh][3].
