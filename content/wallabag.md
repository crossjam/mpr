I was into [omnivore](https://omnivore.app) for some of my
read-it-later and newsletter destination needs. But the team behind it
got acquired and decided to [shut down][3], a bit [abruptly][4] in
fact. I was able to export all my content pretty straightforwardly,
but it was annoying. wallabag is [open source][5] but there’s a well
recommended [hosted service, wallabag.it][6].
