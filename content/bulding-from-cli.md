Link parkin': Luke Wroblewski describes how [Bagcheck practices progressive enhancement][1] by developing the product starting from the web API, then constructing [command line interface (CLI)][2] tools, and thence to client side interfaces.

From a UNIX perspective, I've noticed a CLI is really helpful because you can smoothly tie into standard UNIX scripting tools. This allows for large scale automation which you need more often than not.

**Bonus links**: The [Bagcheck technology stack][3] and [Wroblewski's writings][4] which often include comprehensive notes on interesting conference sessions.
