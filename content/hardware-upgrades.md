* A [**Henge Dock**][1] to park my old MacBook. They've got great marketing materials which sold me, but at the end of the day this feels a bit like a glorified cable organizer. Took a little more effort than I expected to get my machine integrated, and the Ethernet port on my laptop seems misaligned. However, the Henge Dock's vertical orientation of the computer did help me clear some desk space. Still need to live with it for a bit. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying one, just know what you're getting into. Having said all that, I don't intend to send it back.
* An Apple [**Magic Trackpad**][2]. As expected, very elegantly designed and “just works”. Need to get the hang of clicking, selecting, and dragging with it though.
* A Microsoft [**Wireless Desktop 2000**][3] kit. The various Apple keyboards just didn't feel right. I really wanted to go wireless so the full sized USB Apple version was right out. The Apple wireless keyboard is small and light, but cramped. So I went cheap just to get started, and picked up this Microsoft bundle. Seems to be working out fine and the included software correctly remaps the keys to make them Apple compatible.
