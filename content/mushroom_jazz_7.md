So's [Mark Farina][1] with lucky 7 in the Mushroom Jazz series. Well almost. He's taking pre-orders. Of course, like a fanboy, I went for the [collector's edition][2].

And the limited edition [Mushroom Jazz 7 t-shirt][3].

The atoms are supposed to ship on November 9th. Hope the bits are released a week from tomorrow. Really looking forward to what he comes up with this time around.

*On the blogging front, the time off was good. And now I've got plenty to talk about.*
