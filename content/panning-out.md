Well I guess that [the next generation MacBook Pro announcement I was hoping for][1] didn’t really pan out. Haven’t heard a peep out of Apple about anything MacBook related recently, even though the Intel Ivy Bridge announcement happened a few weeks ago. Although [as MacWorld points out][3], the ultrabook version of the processor, slated for release later in the year, would be more appropriate for MacBooks. And Apple typically doesn't pre-announce stuff so the timing would be in line. If they announce it, you can buy it.

Still waiting patiently
