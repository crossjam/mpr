[Tumblelogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog) might be breaking out as a richer complement or alternative to [twitter](http://twitter.com). I always dug the approach of media type specific posting elements and interfaces, but never got a chance to really practice the form.

While [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) has been around for a while, new kid on the block [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) seems be getting attention from the ditherati. I'm enjoying Steve Rubel's [transition to posterous][1] as his primary "lifestreaming" tool and the subsequent explorations. Jennifer Van Grove also [compares and contrasts tumblr and posterous][2].

Two things strike me as interesting about posterous. On the inbound side, hijacking e-mail clients as a posting front end is an old concept, but posterous seems to be taking a fresh approach. Outbound, the routing to multiple popular social media systems feels like a winner. Supporting custom domains is a big step, but I didn't see any real data export capabilities. They're rapidly iterating though, so that might show up soon.

I grabbed a posterous account, but I'm not sure what to do with it yet. Thinking it might be a good way to do link blogging.
