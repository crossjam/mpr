Speaking of [the remix project][1], I finally figured out the perfect name:

<div style="text-align:center;"> <b>The AdoptedArt Project</b> </div>

TA DAH!! Adopted being the antonym of abandoned.

I've even gone ahead and snagged the domain name *AbandonedArt.org* to eventually provide a Web home for the effort. Nothing to see there as of yet though. Move along.
