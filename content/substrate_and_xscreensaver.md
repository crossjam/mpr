Two great tastes that taste great together. [Jamie Zawinski’s
XScreensaver][2] for macOS and [Jared Tarbell’s substrate][1] generative art
algorithm. Stunningly beautiful on a 27" iMac.

Seeing as how I’ve actually used XScreensaver on 1990s vintage UNIX
workstations, and also [mostly reimplemented substrate for my own
ends][3], I’m embarrassed to learn substrate has been in XScreensaver
since 2004. I’ll blame it on being distracted by the XMatrix [digital
rain][4] plugin. That’s the one I default to using via
XScreensaver. Love the little Matrix Reloaded "Easter egg". The
randomizer feature is looking better though, now that you can make
useful subselections of the available screensavers.
