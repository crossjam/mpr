As an experiment in supplying content for various e-readers, they're making [a bunch of previously posted short stories available for 99 cents][1]. Authors include [John Scalzi][4] and [Charles Stross][5], two of my favorites, along with [Elizabeth Bear][3] and [Steven Gould][2], two I need to check out.

It might seem stupid to pay for content that's already been freely posted and is still available on the Web. But I figure it's worth five bucks to to test drive e-books on my iPod touch, buy at a price that works for me, and support the authors. Also, gives me a chance to try out the iBooks and Amazon stores.

Current score, Apple 1, Amazon 0. I can pre-order the short stories from iBooks whereas the Kindle store is showing neither hide nor hair.
