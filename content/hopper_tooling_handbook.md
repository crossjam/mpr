Link parkin’: [_Python Developer Tooling Handboook_][1], by [Tim
Hopper][2].

> This is not a book about programming Python. Instead, the goal of
> this book is to help you understand the ecosystem of tools used to
> make Python development easier and more productive. For example,
> this book will help you make sense of the complex world of building
> Python packages: what exactly are uv, Poetry, Flit, Setuptools, and
> Hatch? What are the pros and cons of each? How do they compare to
> each other? It also covers tools for linting, formatting, and
> managing dependencies. 

Hopper’s handbook is a really rich resource. Despite the mention of
other Python packaging frameworks and tools, clearly the uv wave
(really Astral wave if you add in ruff and ty) landed on those
shores. There’s a lot of good actionable advice. And the
[Explanation][5] section has bunch of foundational, non-Astral, Python
packaging wisdom. The [attendant blog][3] looks great as well.

Tim’s excellent [PyBites Podcast interview episode ][4] tipped me off
to the handbook.
