Things that stood out:

* The funky urban melange of Lincoln Square. All types of folks in a nice little neighborhood, combining single family homes, dense courtyard walkups, family storefronts, and anchored by the Old Town School of Folk Music on Lincoln Ave. Nothing like seeing a punk looking dude, with piercings and tons of skin art, pushing a baby buggy.

* The friendliness of folks taking a casual stroll in the Beverly neighborhood.

* The convenience of Metra and The El.

* The [Harold Washington Library Center][1]. Despite having lived in Chicago for eight years, I'd never visited this library. **Stoopid!** Interesting architecture on the outside, and very nice on the inside. Free Wi-Fi and you can even use a desktop computer as an out of state guest.

* A good old Chicago Polish hot dog.
