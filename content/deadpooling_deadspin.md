[<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Deadspin Headlines.png" alt="Deadspin Headlines.png" border="0" width="780" height="273" style="margin: 10px;"/></div>][1] So I'm not huge on announcing changes to my media intake, but this is such an irksome occasion I feel justified. Once upon a time [Deadspin][1] was a cheeky little sports related site in the vein of "sports and stuff sports fans talk about, including other sports fans." The above screen capture of Deadspin headlines exemplifies its current state. Lots of sports types doing dumb things, tasteless sexual innuendo, and rumors of the day. A sports version of [TMZ.com](http://www.tmz.com/), sans shaky, paparazzi-style videos, might be an apt analogy.

This may be selective memory, but two to three years ago, Deadspin seemed an order of magnitude more intelligent. I know it's hard to compete against the flood of legitimate, sober, sports reporting and opinion on the Web *(yes, I'm serious about that)*, but I honestly feel stupider just reading Deadspin's **headlines**.

I'm sure they won't miss me, but I'm hitting unsubscribe right after I finish this post.
