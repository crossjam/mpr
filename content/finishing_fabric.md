What does "Finishing Fabric" mean? I have successfully collected
digital versions of the 100 releases of [Fabric][1] and the 100
releases of [Fabric Live][2]. For my purposes, the release count
ignores the radio promo mixes. These electronic music mix series were
published via the sister label of the Fabric London nightclub.

So why would anyone in their right mind pursue this?

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

First off, there’s a lot of good music for the ears. Not every last
bit of it is to my taste, but there are more winners than losers. And
I haven’t even managed to give all of it a listen yet.

Second, both series span 17 years, which is **multiple** eternities in
the electronic dance music world. Some of the biggest names in DJ
mixing contributed releases and I’m sure some ground breaking music
was incorporated. The span across genres is impressive: house, tech
house, breaks, hip hop, techno, drum and bass, dubstep, grime, etc. In
some sense, the collection is a historical longitudinal snapshot of
changing musical tastes. Definitely not comprehensive, but maybe
there’s a musicology retrospective study waiting to be unearthed.

Lastly, [fun with Discogs Music Metadata][3]. Let’s just say, trying
to come up with a coherent database view of the Discogs data on these
series has proven challenging in data wrangling, data modeling, and
data engineering senses.
