Title: Digging On Amapiano

Now that I have [working search][2] on this here blog I can ask questions
like, "Have I ever mentioned amapiano music?" And as of this moment,
the answer is "no".

Let’s fix that.

Here’s [the intro paragraph on amapiano][1] from Wikipedia

> Amapiano is a genre of music from South Africa that became popular
> in mid-2012 with an earlier regular occurrence on South African
> radio stations in the early 2000s. It is a hybrid of kwaito, deep
> house, gqom, jazz, soul, and lounge music characterized by synths
> and wide, percussive basslines. The word "amapiano" derives from the
> IsiZulu word for "pianos". 

I can’t pinpoint an exact moment, but it most likely was a few years
ago coming out of the pandemic where I first bumped into the
genre. YouTube tags me as streaming this video of [TxC playing Boiler
Room London][3] four years ago. I’m pretty sure that was the first hit
because I was also somewhat astounded that I’d sit through an hour
long video of a dj session. Or at least have it on in the
background. Also, TxC are definitely a hot look on stage. Last but not
least that was likely my intro to [Boiler Room][4] which will get a
whole post of its own someday.

I’m still a [House][5] and [DnB][6] guy in the main, but I’m always
game to toss in an amapiano mix discovery on Apple Music, which does
some curation and promotion of the form, or anything eye catching from
Boiler Room. Since amapiano partially derives from House this makes
complete sense. Connecting with the African continent is a cherry on
top.

Highly recommended.
