On the drive in to work today I was listening to the local guy talk, faux sports talk, AM show. They opened a segment with a freestyle rap which I could immediately ID as [Q-Tip][3] but couldn’t place the track name.

DJ finally announced it as *Excursions* from [*The Low End Theory*][2]. Hit the parking garage, got outside of the building, and had it downloaded in 5 minutes through the modern miracle of LTE.

Life’s good, but why the hell have I been sleepin’ on *The Low End Theory*? Gotta’ get that on my Jesusphone 5 post haste.
