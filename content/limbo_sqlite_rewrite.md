[Limbo][1] is attempting to deliver an (100%?) [SQLite][3] compatible db engine,
implemented in Rust. As a big time SQLite fan, I have to say _innerestin_:

> 2 years ago, we forked SQLite. We were huge fans of the embedded
> nature of SQLite, but longed for a more open model of
> development. libSQL was born as an Open Contribution project, and we
> invited the community to build it with us.

> As a result, libSQL is an astounding success. With over 12k Github
> stars, 85 contributors, and features like native replication and
> vector search, libSQL is the engine that powers the Turso platform.

> Today we are announcing a more ambitious experiment: what could we
> achieve, if we were to completely rewrite SQLite in a memory-safe
> language (Rust)? With the Limbo project, now available at
> github.com/tursodatabase/limbo, we are now trying to answer that
> question.
