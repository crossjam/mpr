Eventually I’ll get into [k8s][2] enough that this [trick][1] will be useful to know:

> In my opinion, the standard kube-ui is pretty spartan. It doesn’t really give me a good overview of what is going on in my cluster.

> Weave Scope is an open source tool that helps you monitor and visualize your cluster. It is currently very beta, but I think it has a lot of potential!

> Running it is also super easy.

Plus I really like what the [Weave][3] folks have been up to.

Thanks Sandeep!
