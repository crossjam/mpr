Of Richard K. Morgan's book [*Thirteen*][3], a.k.a. *Black Man* in the UK, [I once wrote][2]:

<blockquote><em>

Published in 2007, I wonder how Morgan interpreted the events of the 2008 Presidential elections. Must have sort of felt like contradiction and vindication at the same time.

</em></blockquote>

Given [what happened to Representative Bob Inglis][1] (R-S.C.), I'd bet Morgan would tell me it's all vindication. What contradiction?

Inglis fell victim to a Tea Party wave in South Carolina, despite being, in word and deed, inarguably conservative. Just not ornery enough to be completely obstructionist. And he had well reasoned positions and arguments *(such an elitist intellectual thing to do)*.

We're getting to the point where bringing reason to a political argument is like [bringing a knife][4] to the proverbial Chicago gunfight.
