I‘ve noodled around with turning the [Retrosheet][1] data into SQL for MySQL and PostgreSQL, but never did anything further. Now that I've dug into [Tastypie][2] a bit, it might be fun and easy to wrap such a database with a RESTful Web API. Desktop visualizations could be easily created, but even better you could do neat browser based renderings given the direction of new toolkits like [D3][3].
