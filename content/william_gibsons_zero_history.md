[Thanks to Annalee Newitz][2] I found out that William Gibson is coming out with a new book entitled [*Zero History*][1]. Looks like it'll be some sort of continuation of the themes in [*Pattern Recognition*][3] and [*Spook Country*][4].

[I'm in the tank for Gibson][5] so I'm eagerly looking forward to *Zero History*, although [*Spook Country* did let me down][6]. Instead of springing for the *Zero History* hardback, I may wait for the paperback. Or better yet, borrow it from my local library.
