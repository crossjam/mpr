If as speculated, the new versions will incorporate a significant processor bump, Thunderbolt I/O, and MacOS X Lion, that might be a very tempting purchase later in the year. 

Going on 3 years old, [my current MacBook][3] is starting to get a little long in the tooth. It's currently quite serviceable, but if I get deeper into hacking like I'd like to, some extra cycles would be useful. Having an ultralite notebook would also be a plus.
