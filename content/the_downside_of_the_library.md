I love the [Arlington County Public Library](http://www.acornweb.org/). Close to work. Nice selection of books. Well designed public space. Rock solid Wi-Fi.

But most of the books I've borrowed have had some kind of damage. Not so bad that they were unreadable obviously, but it feels like somebody's spilled a cup of coffee or a coke on every book in the Science Fiction section.

Still can't beat the price though.
