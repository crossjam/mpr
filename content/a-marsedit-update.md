> MarsEdit 3.5.9 is now available. This is a free update for licensed MarsEdit customers. The update will be submitted to the Mac App Store today and will be available there when Apple approves the update.

> This is quite a significant update, in spite of it being entirely composed of “bug fixes.” I’m still working a major update to MarsEdit that will accommodate the Mac App Store’s sandboxing requirements. Until that is ready, I’ll keep fixing bugs in the app but will not be able to add significant features.

I’m grateful to [Red Sweater software](http://www.red-sweater.com/) for picking up and maintaining [MarsEdit][2]. It’s been in my toolbox for **years** and is coming back into prominence now that I’m using Ye Olde MacBook more. If you’ve noticed  more original text here, it’s partially because I’m back to using a keyboard and MarsEdit.
