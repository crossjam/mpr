On its recent [10th birthday][1], I'm acknowledging [Nelson Minar's *Some Bits* weblog](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/) as another site I routinely enjoy. As Minar says:

> *My weblog is an old school blog, a public diary of things that personally interest me. I mostly write as a way to summarize what I'm learning about something new like living in Paris or flying airplanes.
> ...
> Go ahead, write something, it's not hard! Even if no one but yourself ever reads it it's worth your time.*

I'm not so much into the foodie or GA posts, but I usually find the tech nuggets quite good. For example, I was tipped off, by Some Bits, to Adam Fast's [Neogeography blog][2], which looks top notch.
