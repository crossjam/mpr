This week my teams went a frustrating 2 and 2. It's almost enough to make me [not care][1]. The real travesty was having to rely on the Redskins against the Eagles. Guaranteed disappointment.

Three out of four teams are solid winners, currently holding fantasy playoff spots.

And then there's Justice Society.

More after the break.

Doom Patrol was a slight underdog. The opponent went for 142 points, highest total in the league this year. Tough to beat a guy when four out of his eight players total 109 points. Still tied for second in the league, and ahead on point total.

Doom Patrol Beta rolled, although there was still room for a collapse going into the Monday night game. Luckily the Eagles Donovan McNabb didn't explode. Meanwhile, I had the Eagles defense which whaled on the hapless Redskins. I'm holding sole possession of first place in this league.

The New Mutants of the NFL.com league pushed out to a big early lead and then won by a comfortable 16 points. I think I'm still in the playoffs with this team.

My ESPN league team, Justice Society, endured the most painful loss I've ever suffered in fantasy football. Going into Monday night, I had a 26 point lead. The team was facing the Eagles defense and the Eagles LeSean McCoy, a backup running back. So of course the starting running back, Brian Westbrook, gets hurt giving McCoy plenty of opportunity to rack up points. Still he had a mild day, scoring 6 points.

Of course the Eagles D goes for 21, giving me a brutal 1 point loss. Even worse is that as I watched the real time scoring tracker, after they achieved their 6th sack I was down by one and resigned to a loss. Then the 'Skins drove for a garbage touchdown which took three off their score. McCoy added another fantasy point before the end of the game. I went to bed thinking I had won.

Wake up in the morning, and the official scorer had awarded the Eagles defense with another fumble recovery. 2 more fantasy points and I lose.

The fantasy gods giveth. The fantasy gods taketh away.
