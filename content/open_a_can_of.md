[Cal paid Maryland][1] back for that drubbing in College Park last year. In spades. I don't know how good or bad the Terps are, but Cal seems to be living up to their ranking.

Looking ahead to the rest of [Cal's schedule][2], clearly the big hump in the season is Oregon on September 26th and USC on October 3rd. The rest of the Pac-10 isn't chopped liver, but if they manage to win those two games, there's a real shot at a Rose Bowl in my lifetime.

Big **IF** though. Beating the University of Spoiled Children is always a tough get for the Bears. At least the Trojans are coming to Berkeley.
