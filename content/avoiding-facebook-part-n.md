Where N is quite large. From [Sophos’ NakedSecurity blog][1]
> Even if you have rejected particular apps from connecting from your Facebook profile, you have no control over what apps your friends and family have chosen to connect to their profiles.

> Your friends and family may not be being as cautious as you are about Facebook apps - and you may not realise that when other Facebook users choose to install apps they can then share the information they can see about you with those apps.

> Facebook argues that allowing other people to share your info with third-party apps makes the "experience better and more social". Your opinion may vary from theirs, however.
