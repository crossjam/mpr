One other thing that could help smooth [my information trapping][1] is to leverage starring in Google Reader more, instead of e-mail. While e-mail is pretty cheap, [starring is a one key gesture][2]. Since I've already figured out how to post e-mail to a folder, and written a cron script to continuously download my starred items, it's a short step to combining the two for automated item capture.
