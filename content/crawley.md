It’s never actually materialized, but I’m still hoping that user grade, commodity cost, [focused crawlers][1] become a reality. Seems like the tech has caught up with the concept. Maybe something like Crawley plus Python’s copious machine learning and data mining toolkits could provide the foundation.

I believe not actually telling folks you’re exploiting focused crawling is one of the key tricks.
