From *5 Magazine*, Chicago’s own House Music chronicle, comes [news of a newly released documentary][1]
> Centuries (okay, a few years) ago, Steven Harnell began recording footage for something tentatively given the very tentative title of An Untitled Documentary About House Music. A few people asked me about it, but the project seemed to be sliding into oblivion – until a couple of weeks ago, the site hadn’t been updated since around 2008.

> So it was with some surprise that I realized that the Untitled Doc and Unconscious Therapy, a documentary debuting at the Chicago International Movies & Music Festival this Saturday, were one and the same.

Well gosh darn if [dreams][2] sometimes don’t come *(mostly)* true. Still need to see if it’s any good, and requires some sort of DC release, but the film is past a hurdle 90% of film projects don’t cross. So good on ’ya Steve Harnell.

And today all of us could use a little unconscious therapy. *As he goes to put on a [Mark Farina mix][3].*
