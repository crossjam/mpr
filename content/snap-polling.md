Saw [this post][1] by Carl Franzen, a while ago on IdeaLab. Found it interesting that there maybe a new “polling science” that could emerge out of real-time social media analytics. The trick will be having some real science, backed by validation.
> Social media is a big draw for over 2.3 billion users around the globe, but its true value is only starting to be unlocked, according to Poptip, a New York-based startup company has seen early success running quick, realtime text analysis of tweets on Twitter as a kind of hi-tech snap polling method.

> Mainstream companies from Pepsi to People Magazine to ESPN have begun experimenting with Poptip's first and to date, only product, an app that allows users to post their questions on Twitter, then tracks and displays responses from respondents in realtime.

Even curiouser, the original post seems to have disappeared from IdeaLab. Factually incorrect? Scammed? Weird. Need to do some digging.
