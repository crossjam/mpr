Title: Yeah, What Thomas Said
Status: published

It’s a sort of classic Internet, spicy hot take, grenade in the hole
rant (old Usenet heads will recognize the type), but there’s a lot in
Thomas Ptacek’s [_My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts_][1] that had me
nodding my head. And I’m not even an AI hipster. (_Although a bit of
[fly.io](https:fly.io) fanboy_)

Ptacek has the bona fides to back this up. To be sure, his focus is on
coding and software development assistance, but that’s why I nodded my
head so much. Can’t claim jumping in with both feet, doing a ton of
vibe coding, and deploying to prod with my co-pilot. However, my gut
tells me this change is on the order of impact that compilers had on
programming. In 3-5 years we’ll be going, "did we really do it that way?".

YMMV.

_P.S. When I grow up, I want to write like Thomas Ptacek_
