I like Python. I like PostgreSQL. I like PyCon. I should like [PyPgDay][1].
> In coordination with the Postgres community and PyCon US 2013, PyPgDay is occurring in Santa Clara on March 13 from 9am-6pm.

> PyPgDay will be a full-day event with seven talks about PostgreSQL and Python, including talks by contributors to PostgreSQL, Django, PostGIS, and Python. Half the talks will help PostgreSQL DBAs, and the other half will focus on developing Python applications using Postgres features.
