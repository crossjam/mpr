Didn't think it was possible, but there's a worthy challenger to [*The Human Resource*][2], which was pretty [high on my list][3]. While the last half of *The Human Resource* is still the height of brilliance, *Us Against the World* is a great ride.

Of course this makes complete sense. While *The Human Resource* is credited to Dieselboy, a close read of the cover reveals it's "Dieselboy presents...". One CD is remixes of various DnB tracks. The other, a continuous play mix, is entitled *Assemble The Monster*,...

... by [Evol Intent][4].

Now if they'd only drop a few more DJ mixes.
