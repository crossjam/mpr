My subscription for the [Overcast][1] podcast player renewed today,
for which I have no qualms. Really happy with the app, glad to support
[an independent developer][2], and would highly recommend to
others. 

I’m sure there other fine iOS podcast apps out there, but Overcast
works really well for me.
