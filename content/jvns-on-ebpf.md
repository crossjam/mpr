I [told you][2] BSD Packet Filtering was cool. How cool? So cool that [Julia Evans thinks it’s cool][1]. She wrote up some notes on a talk regarding [the original BPF paper][3]. When she gets amped about something everybody gets an enthusiastic and accessible explanation.

> But BPF has been around for a long time! Now we live in the EXCITING FUTURE which is eBPF. I’d heard about eBPF a bunch before but I felt like this helped me put the pieces together a little better. (i wrote this XDP & eBPF post back in April when I was at netdev)

There’s an easy peasy list of places in Linux where you can hang an eBPF program, plus her post is chock full of links to relevant material.

*Brush with greatness. [I used to be a barista for Nefeli Caffè][4] on the north side of the Berkeley campus, around the corner from Soda Hall. I worked the closing night shift a lot. Steve McCanne was a regular. No small talk. Really hot, double cappuccino and see ya’.*
