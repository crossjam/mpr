Flip Saunders was [relieved of his coaching duties][2] and probably restored of his sanity. Godspeed kind sir. You deserved better than the dreck you were served.

The scary thought is that this move could buy Ernie Grunfeld more time to damage the team. As Jason Reid points out, he needs to go quickly. Especially because there are some player personnel moves that need to be quickly executed in the hopes that John Wall and others don't permanently catch the losing bug.

Basketball Prospectus had the scariest headline I've seen today: [*“What if the Wizards Don't Get Better?”*][3].
