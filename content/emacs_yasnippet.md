I’ve been looking for a way to jump start my blog post authoring
process via text expansion or templating within Emacs. Just haven’t
had the time to go digging. Luckily a potential solution came to me:
[YASnippet][1]

> YASnippet is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
> abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
> templates. ...  The snippet syntax is inspired from TextMate's
> syntax, you can even import most TextMate templates to YASnippet.

[Source code][2] and [info from EmacsWiki][3].
