Here’s a study I’d be interested in seeing just on general interest. The usage of Twitter as a comedy platform. Seems like there’s a `@FakeX` account for any value of `X` and half a million “@!*$ My Whatever Says”.  Is this a new comedic venue? How big is it in terms of creators, participants, and dollars? And put it all in a comedy historic context for me.

Bonus points if you’re funny.

*Sigh. So many ideas. So little time.*
