Since the live matches shown here in the states are on Saturday and Sunday morning, gives me something to watch instead of the US football pre-game yakfests.

And jeez did [Manchester City][1] deliver an interesting display this morning, opening a can of whoop-ass on Manchester United *(yeah that Manchester United)* to the tune of [a 6-1 beating][3]. This was administered on the Man U home pitch of Old Trafford. By the end it sounded like the Red Devils were just mailing it in. Now Man City is five points clear of the pack.

Then of course, my horse in the race, Chelsea FC, spit the bit, losing to Queens Park Rangers. The Blues could have jumped over Man U to take second in the tables. I feel like Chelsea has a solid team, with a lot of quality, but not quite the character to take the trophy. 

Still, there's a long way to go. By my calculation the league hasn't even reached the quarter pole in terms of games played, and there's 7 months left in the campaign.
