The 20.04 Ubuntu Long Term Support release (Focal Fossa) [officially supports the Raspberry Pi!][1]

> Running Ubuntu Server on your Raspberry Pi is easy. Just pick the OS image you want, flash it onto a microSD card, load it onto your Pi and away you go.

With [handy installation instructions][2] to boot.

Long term readers may remember that I put together [a stack of Raspberry Pis][3] just for run one Christmas season. They haven’t been doing much since, but because I’m a heavy user of Ubuntu at work, maybe I can get more mileage out of them.
