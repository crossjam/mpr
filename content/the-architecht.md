Derrick Harris used to be a GigaOM reporter on the big data beat. When GigaOM went under he moved on to doing media for [Mesosphere][3]. 

Looks like Harris launched out on his own again in January, doing a combo of blogging, newsletter, and podcasting. All of it can be found at [architecht.io][1]. The interviewee lineup on the [podcast][2] looks especially good with some high profile names like Eric Brewer, Mike Olson, Jay Kreps, and Julia Austin.
