[Spoke too soon][2] about the death of the writer's advice posts that io9's Charlie Jane Anders had been delivering. [A new one popped up][1] today with a list of 4 basic writing tips. I find it hard to believe that anyone seriously aspiring to be published didn't already know these basic hints for avoiding lifeless, limp writing.

What do I know though? The post seems to be attracting a decent number of views and comments, at least relative to some other posts currently on the front page. I guess there must be plenty of wannabe authors in the io9 audience.
