[*The Rundown*][1] popped up on HDNet this past week. A little over 8 years since its release, the movie has held up surprisingly well. Actually, it shouldn't be all that surprising. *The Rundown* is a pretty basic action film, not overly enhanced with sci-fi techno elements, or CG special effects. Fights, double-crosses, chases, captures. Hero wins in the end. 

Herewith some of the reasons I enjoyed watching it yet again:

* Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson actually evinced a little acting depth.

* The directer, Peter Berg, tightly paced the flick with no fat. Comes in at a clean, efficient hour and a half. Plus there's actually a distinctive visual style to the whole affair.

* Christopher Walken doing a great, batshit exploitative warlord.

* Rosario Dawson is, as always, easy on the eyes.

* The film is actually funny in quite a few spots. *Go away monkey!!* Seann William Scott's scruffy ass actually adds a solid comedic lift.

* The kick ass opening sequence. Heck, all the fight sequences. Well done and not your run of the mill punch out.

You could do quite a bit worse than *The Rundown* on a slow, weekend afternoon.

**Update.** *Forgot about the Arnie cameo.*
