At work, I was finally privileged to receive a MacBook Pro back in November. Man do I love it! 

One of the nice things about using the same OS at work and at home is that I exploit some of the hidden power features more consistently. One such feature on OS X is Apple's [Spotlight, the built-in desktop search service][1]. Even better, Spotlight is easily accessible through [LaunchBar][3], so I don't even have to remember another key combination for search. Command-Space plus a few keystrokes gets me to web search or desktop search.

Once upon a time at work, they allowed us to have [Google Desktop][2] on Windows, which is the best desktop search I've ever experienced. Spotlight isn't nearly as nice, but it works sufficiently, especially on indexing my Thunderbird e-mail. That's where every other desktop search tool I tried, Mac or Windows, failed miserably. Indexing and searching my e-mail is pretty important, since I like to [use mail for information trapping][4].
