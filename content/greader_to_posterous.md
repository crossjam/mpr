[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/posterous logo.png" alt="posterous logo.png" border="0" width="129" height="130" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Recently, Google Reader added [a number of new features][3], including the ability to directly post items to various blog-like tools. [posterous][1] quickly came out with a hack to support this posting capability, but the GReader team just went and added [posterous as an official "Send To" location][2].

This could be a great tool for link blogging since you can add notes to the items. I wonder if it shares the entire item or just a title and link. I'll have to do some experimentation.

Also, apropos of nothing, HTML is allowed in an e-mail post to posterous, so you can do some good old basic styling and linking.
