[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/GlobalGirl Media Logo.png" alt="GlobalGirl Media Logo.png" border="0" width="321" height="127" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />](http://www.globalgirlmedia.org) So I was kvetching a little about ESPN providing some local color in its [World Cup coverage][2], *(Just a minor kvetch!)*, so I have to give them some props today. During halftime of the replay of Netherlands-Uruguay, they turned over some studio time to Julie Foudy and [her work][1] with [GlobalGirl Media](http://www.globalgirlmedia.org).  While the on-air piece wasn't strictly World Cup related, they do have a couple of football related pieces on the site.

Good on ya ESPN!
