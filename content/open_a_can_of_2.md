What's with the TD vulture Vereen messing up Jahvid Best's Heisman highlight reel? Next week the Bears are on the road at Minnesota which will definitely be a step up from Maryland and Eastern Washington. At home the Terps barely escaped James Madison University, an FCS (nee 1AA) school.

Have to say the Michigan - Notre Dame tilt was pretty good, especially given who the loser was. Time to dig into some Golden Domer angst on the Web, although I'm sure they're convinced that they're just one step away.

And is it me, or does the Big 12 look really suspect this season?
