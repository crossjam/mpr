A few years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting and chit-chatting with [Paco Nathan][1]. Back then he was with DataBricks, but now he’s at O’Reilly Media doing interesting things with [Jupyter][5] and [learning][4]. I enjoyed couple of his recent presentations. The first on [AI inside O’Reilly Media][2].

And one on [a TextRank rewrite in Python][3].

*Yowsa! That slideshare shortcode actually worked. We'll see how it comes out in the RSS feed*
