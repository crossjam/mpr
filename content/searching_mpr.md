Boy am I a dope.

I’ve been fiending for search capabilities on this here ’blog for
ages. Never got around to putting something together dreading grinding
through HTML and JavaScript coding. So I just limped along with
`site:crossjam.net` modifiers in search engines.

About this time last year, I [posted][1] about [pagefind][2]. pagefind
is a JavaScript toolkit for creating embedded search indexes to go
along with static server pages. Looked easy peasy to run and use. Lame
old me still dragged his feet.

Finally for some Friday hacking, I decided to push through and see if
I could get pagefind based search working in an experimental fashion.

After reacquainting myself with the pagefind docs, I had it working in
an hour 🙄. Still have a few bits to polish, but once it’s working
there will be an honest to gosh [search page][3]
