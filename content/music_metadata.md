One thing about the new iPod Nano is that to maximize enjoyment, your metadata should be as clean and accurate as possible. I've started to wade in and work on my library. Now I'm really appreciating the utility of [TuneUp](http://www.tuneupmedia.com/download/) and [Discogs.com](http://discogs.com). The former has done a good job cleaning up 90% of what I've thrown at it. Plus it pulls in cover art. The latter is handy for finding cover art which TuneUp doesn't get right.

So far I think there's only one playlist which I'll have to clean up by hand. For whatever reason, [DJ John Howard's](http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Howard) [San Francisco Sessions v2](http://www.discogs.com/DJ-John-Howard-San-Francisco-Sessions-Vol-2/release/21535) is really screwed up in the automated tagging systems. The artist and title information is flipped. But if that's all I have to grind over, TuneUp will have paid for itself.
