Have to say I'm somewhat looking forward to the upcoming releases of [*Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol*][1] and [*Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows*][2]. Both are clearly guilty pleasures. For *Mission Impossible*, while I like the action, [Paula Patton][3] is an extremely fetching attraction. As to *Sherlock Holmes*, while the incessant mumbling of Robert Downey Jr. can be irritating, I like the comic chemistry he has with Jude Law.

Now I can see how well [the local cinema][4] holds up during holiday season!
