Today, September 11th, was rather somber and gray here in Washington, DC. The day started off quite rainy and never completely cleared up.

In the past, I've watched [United 93][1] or MSNBC's replay of the day's events in 2001. I could find neither for my evening viewing. Instead, I got Bud Fox, Gordon Gekko, and the World Trade Center in Oliver Stone's [Wall Street][2], its themes and sermons still quite appropriate 22 years later.
