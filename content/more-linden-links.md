Greg Linden is back with [another collection of interesting links][1]. A skoosh more business oriented than is my want, and probably more than any one human should read in a single sitting, but still some good nuggets to be had:

> The future of maps on smartphones: "It'll be like you're a local everywhere you go. You'll know your way through the back alleys and hutongs of Beijing, you'll know your way all around Paris even if you've never been before. Signs will seem to translate themselves for you. This kind of extra-smartness is coming to people." ([1][2])
