With a bit of a break in the work storm last night, I tapped into two first round NBA Eastern Conference playoff series: ’76ers vs Bulls and Hawks vs Celtics. Both were elimination games so I was hoping for some high drama at the end.

As The Basketball Jones points out, [both series ended in horrible thuds][1].

The Bulls, having been a smart, consistently hard working, high executing team wasted great defensive effort on bone-headedness. Sorry C. J. Watson, but that was just the wrong play.

The Hawks were just robbed. The officials messed up on both Joe Johnson’s drive and the in bounds play. Then the Hawks went all Hawks on us, acting stupid and choking on the line. They couldn’t even get off of a long range heave for three to try and tie it. Typical Hawks.

High drama indeed.

***Ob Wiz**. Please Lakers. Knock Javale McGee out of the playoffs. However, I do admit it might be fun to continue the playoffs with the Lakers out and the Clippers in.*
