Well, I got all excited about the AC Milan v FC Barcelona Champions league match yesterday for nothing. A 0-0 draw makes for a dud. Even worse, the big players just missed plays in the final third. And I've never seen topflight defenders diddle around in the box so much. Maybe it‘s a strategic approach I‘m not sophisticated enough to get, but seemed like they were constantly playing with fire.

Hopefully the other half of the tie, next week at the Camp Nou, will be a lot better. Winner take all, bet on Barca.
