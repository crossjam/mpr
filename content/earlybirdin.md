Took advantage of [the early bird rate][2] to save a few shekels and I'm at least guaranteed a spot for the talks. Still need to sign up for a couple of [tutorials][3], but I will be back in Da Bay for the first time in well over a year, probably starting late on March 6th.

I definitely want the [promised cookie][4]. If on the off hand there are any other Pythonistas reading this blog planning to attend, feel free to shoot **`b m d at crossjam dot net`** an e-mail ahead of the proceedings.
