For the longest time I've been really irritated by [an old iTunes on iOS misfeature][1]. If a playlist or track name was really long, there was no way to scroll it and see the cut off portion.

Imagine my surprise this past Friday, when I just happen to press on a playlist name for an extended period of time and up pops a black balloon with the full name. Don't know when Apple fixed it, but irritant removed. Good on ya, Cupertino.
