Typically I don’t find Hacker News discussion threads enlightening although I frequent the site. But this one on [loading half a billion rows into MySQL][1] was actually quite good. Mainly because there were a few links to other interesting technologies such as: [Snowplow][2], [Trecul][3], and [crush-tools][4]. 

And the [original link][5] was useful as well even though I’m not a MySQL fan.
