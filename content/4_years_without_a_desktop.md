It's been well over 4 years since I officially pulled out of Chicago at the end of my previous gig. That was the last time I used a desktop machine on a regular basis. Oh sure, I've still got the Dell box running the latest [Ubuntu server edition][1], but that machine's stuffed in the basement of the townhouse. I generally ssh into it, and the only time I use the attached monitor is when I'm upgrading the distro.

I don't quite know what that really says but it seems like a sign of something. I'm not in the nerd top 1% but I'm up there. In college, I built a computer out of wire, chips, and breadboard. I programmed it with switches. The only output it had was [blinkenlights][2].

That was some of the most fun I ever had.

There have been a few times since where I've thought, "Wonder what I can get at the low end of the desktop market." Now I'm not sure I'm even interested, although a Mac Mini is a little tempting. Only because I could probably afford a good laptop **in addition** to a used Mac Mini or micro-PC. Still, I'm probably much more inclined to get just a 15" MacBook pro, like a lot of the folks on [The Setup][3].

What it really says is that mobility has trumped all. The laptop is the briefcase of our era. Soon that might be the pad.

Reminds me, I need to get around to buying an app phone.
