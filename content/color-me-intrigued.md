It’s just a beginning though, with not much querying into JSON objects. 

Jerry Sievert is attempting to [replicate the features of MongoDB in Postgres][1]. His first post just outlines how to implement the basic document insert and lookup features. If he can pull off the document query API of MongoDB, or even a reasonable subset, then things get interesting.

Still reserving judgement.
