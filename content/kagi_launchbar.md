A few months back, I ponied up for a [high end subscription][4] to the [Kagi
search engine][5]. Meanwhile, the [LaunchBar app][3] is embedded in my
fingertips. I was poking around for ways to plug Kagi into LaunchBar
(using Kagi search ’natch). Found two decent looking plugins:

* [Bash][1], by Andrew Sardone
* [JavaScript][2], by Florian Eckerstorfer

These look simple enough that I should spend some time to learn how to
write LaunchBar actions myself. If there isn’t an analogous Kagi
action in Python there should be.
