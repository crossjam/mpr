Good on [PandoDaily](http://pandodaily.com) for generating [an executive summary][1] of the announcements at the latest Apple event. As an Apple customer, I'm intrigued by the new iPad, although it's not a game changer. *(Didn't really expect it to be).* I'll wait to see what the reviews are on battery life versus 4G LTE are. LTE seems to me the only real discriminator. 

I'm still tempted by the Apple TV, especially since it's fairly cheap *(1st world talking here).* 1080p was one of my prior showstoppers, but that's been fixed.

[Still waiting][2] for my 15 inch display, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD MacBook Air-alike.
