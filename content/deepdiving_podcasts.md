Title: Deep Diving Podcasts

One of the reasons I’ve become interested in deep analytical dives of
podcasts is because of [Software Engineering (SE) Radio][1]. It’s not quite
at the top of my podcast fave lists because I don’t feel an urge to
listen to it regularly. However, the content is typically excellent
and I like the no nonense interview style. A little topic
introduction, a little guest bio, and then right into the technical
discussion. No ads either. 

The analytic draw is the historical depth of the content. SE Radio
launched back in **2006**, 16 years ago. There are 511 episodes as of
this writing. It’s provided under a [Creative Commons 2.5
License][2]. There are so many summarization possibilities to apply
and questions to be answered of such a corpus. Think of all the tech
topics that have come up over the years. Not to mention that there are
some exceedingly distinguished guests making appearances. How have the
themes and personalities ebbed and flowed over the years? What
programming languages have ascended and waned? Are there any enduring
repeat offenders? How does this all connect and intersect with the
wider tech topic podcast ecosystem?

And that’s just a single long lived podcast! Between [The Python
Podcast.\_\_Init\_\_][3] (363) and the [Data Engineering Podcast][4]
(288), Tobias Macey has delivered 651 episodes, **primarily by
himself**. For almost any vertical topic you can imagine, there are
probably at least a decent handful of well rooted podcasts worth deep
diving on.

I’ll need to get a good lawyer to interpret the license, but the only
show stopper might be the legality of building publicly available
systems that derive from analytics of the podcast episodes. On the one
hand, I feel like this might be like podcast search indexing which
would seem to not be a derivative work. On the other, you are building
on the content sooo...

Now whether all of the episodes can actually be collected is a
technical challenge for another day.
