The hometown Caps looked pretty good after brushing aside the Rangers in five games. Bad enough they got eliminated last night, but they got swept by the Tampa Bay Lightning. Frankly, I thought they mailed it in for game 4, which could be indicative of team character flaws.

And the Red Wings are in deep doo as well, down 3-0 to the Sharks. If you're in the NHL playoffs and your team color incorporates a heave dose of red, this doesn't look like your year.
