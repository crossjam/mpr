[man.cx][1] is a really well done web site for UNIX manual pages. From the front page:

<blockquote><em>

Have you ever wanted to check a manual page for a tool you hadn't installed on the current machine? Well, it happend to me various times. There are some manpage interfaces available on the net, but they all just provide access to the GNU tools or maybe to the tools installed on the host, but they are always missing some pages. So I thought, why isn't there a page with all manpages? So I just built one.

</em></blockquote>

Might be worth turning into a LaunchBar shortcut.
