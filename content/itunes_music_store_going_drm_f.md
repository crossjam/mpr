Image cribbed from the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/01/apple-promises.html">in depth analysis</a> from Wired Epicenter by Elliot Van Buskirk. And just when I was about to seriously start considering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?node=163856011">Amazon's MP3 Downloads</a>.

Looks like there might be some blog mileage in digging into each service's dj mix catalog and seeing what I find.
