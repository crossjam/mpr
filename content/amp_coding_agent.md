> ### [Why Amp?][1]
> 
> Amp is a frontier coding agent for your terminal and editor, built
> by Sourcegraph. 
> 
> - Multi-Model: Sonnet, GPT-5, fast models—Amp uses them all, for
>   what each model is best at. 
> - Opinionated: You’re always using the good parts of Amp. If we
>   don’t use and love a feature, we kill it. 
> - On the Frontier: Amp goes where the models take it. No backcompat,
>   no legacy features. 
> - Threads: You can save and share your interactions with Amp. You
>   wouldn’t code without version control, would you?
>
>  Amp has 2 modes: smart (unconstrained state-of-the-art model use)
>  and free (free of charge, using fast basic models).

This post was started before a recent edition of [Hamel Husain’s
newsletter][4] arrived in my transom today (_apologies, can’t find a
Web page version to link to_). He’s positive on Amp as well:

> Even though Cursor is my daily driver, I frequently try new coding

> Amp. Amp is the [Omakase][5] experience of coding agents: the team
> [maniacally experiments][3] with the frontier of coding models, and

Typical of Husain, his email contains much more detail, including
caveats for working with Amp. For example, the version of Amp that he
uses is priced on a per-token basis. This can get expensive if you’re
not careful. Also, he reported that the Amp CLI had problems with
iTerm, but works well in Ghostty. Hopefully it’ll be made available
somewhere easy to reference.

The field of terminal user-interface coding agents is getting crowded,
but Amp is worth watching.
