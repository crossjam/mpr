I get a lot of my good tech nuggets through the [O’Reilly Radar][4] blog. This year they’ve given [a heads-up on their themes][1], and the process behind their selection, for 2013:
> In our discussions we worked through about 35 potential themes and narrowed them down to 10 that we are actively working on in the first quarter of 2013. Here’s the list along with the Radar team member who is focused on it.

Topics like In-Memory Data Management, Consumer AI, and Future of Programming look really interesting, but I’m really curious to see how [Ben Lorica][3] and [Nat Torkington][2] tie in.
