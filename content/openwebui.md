Link parkin’: [Open WebUI][1], a well done, open source, frontend to
LLM APIs. From [the Open WebUI docs][2]:

> Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly
> self-hosted AI interface designed to operate entirely offline. It
> supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible
> APIs. 

Interestingly the project has an [academic looking paper][4] on
building a platform for LLM evaluation and auditing attached.
