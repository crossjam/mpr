[*Apocalypse Now*][5] is one of the five best films I've seen in my entire life. I'm saddened to hear that [Dennis Hopper][4] has passed on. He was one of the more memorable parts of *Apocalypse Now* despite a fairly small role. A couple of [choice][7] [quotes][6] from The Photojournalist.

<blockquote style="padding : 2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom:0.2em;"><em>

"What are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say? That he was a kind man? That he was a wise man? That he had plans? That he had wisdom? Bullshit man!"

</em></blockquote>

<blockquote style="padding : 2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom:0.2em;"><em>

You can't travel in space, you can't go out into space, you know, without, like, you know, uh, with fractions. What are you going to land on - one-quarter, three-eighths? What are you going to do when you go from here to Venus or something? That's dialectic physics.

</em></blockquote>

Hopper had a pretty interesting and varied career in the cinema and on the television, appearing in [*Rebel Without a Cause*][8] along with writing and directing [*Easy Rider*][9]. Many folks in Hollywood would have been happy to call that a career. My only thought is that somehow Hopper and Quentin Tarantino should have worked on a project together. Yeah, Hopper had that really uncomfortable scene with Christopher Walken in [*True Romance*][10], which was written by Tarantino, but it's not quite the same. Hopper and Harvey Keitel  working together and directed by Tarantino? Intense!!

Godspeed kind sir.
