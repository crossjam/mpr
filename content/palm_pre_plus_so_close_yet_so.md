Just recently, I regaled you with my [lust for the upcoming HTC Evo][3] as my ideal smartphone cum 3G hotspot. Well, Verizon just went and theoretically blew that lust out of the water with [announcements][2] about the [Palm Pre Plus][1]:

* First off, you can actually buy a Palm Pre Plus now, as opposed to this summer for the Evo.

* The Palm Pre Plus **can** be used as a WiFi serving, portable 3G hotspot, ala [the MiFi][4].

* Verizon completely dropped the data fee for using the device as a hotspot.

* Verizon dropped the hardware price to *$49.99*, two year contract obviously. But the 1 year contract price is a reasonable $149.99.

* Through work, I can get a 20% discount on the voice plan and the mandatory data part of the plan. Bottom line, I'd wind up paying about $70 a month. Quite manageable.

* It's not on AT&T's network.

So what's not to like? Well, the device runs Palm's webOS. All the cool geeks are on Android and the hipsters on iPhone OS. Besides Engadget drew up [a survival guide for Palm][6]. Meanwhile, ArsTechnica just flat out [declared Palm dead][5]. The comments on the ArsTechnica are pretty damning as well.

But for a year, it might be worthwhile. Palm can't die that fast can they? In that one year, something Evo-like might come to Verizon and there could actually be some [real rollout of LTE][7].

*Very, very tempting*
