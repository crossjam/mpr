*Grumble.*

[Previously][2] in these here parts, I claimed that five people needed to depart the organization: Andray Blatche, Flip Saunders, Nick Young, Javale McGee, and … Ernie Grunfeld. Grunfeld has managed to at least clean up a little this year by getting rid of the aforementioned four, but I still really fear his draft prowess, or lack thereof.

As a Wizards fan, it’s difficult to see how this was in any sense “earned”. There’s a nine year track record of Ernie’s ability and while there was a nice post-season streak, some **spectacularly** bad personnel moves provide counterbalance. We’ll have to defer to owner privilege on this one, but I don’t know too many DC folks who aren’t scratching their heads.

I do have precedence for sustained loyalty in the face of silliness like this. After Jordan retired I adopted the Chicago Bulls along with oft embattled GM Jerry Krause. Krause managed to scorch the franchise to the ground *([Kornel David][3] era anybody?)* and get some interesting pieces (Elton Brand, Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Ron Artest, Jamal Crawford) that never really panned out.  Things didn’t really pick up for the Bulls until Krause was long gone and they lucked into Derrick Rose.

So I’m not gonna’ let Ernie sticking around bum me out. Maybe lightning will strike this year and their top pick will be a superstar *(the first since Wes Unseld?)*. Please though Ted, get Ernie some draft evaluation assistance. And stay away from the European picks!!
