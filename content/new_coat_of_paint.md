Title: New Coat of Paint

_For some reason, this post was scheduled for June of 2020 (!!) but
never posted. Letting it loose now to clean out the drafts folder._

For the first time ever intentionally, I rethemed one of my
blogs. [New Media Hack][1] got a new theme only because I had to apply
something during the transfer to WordPress. [Mass Programming
Resistance][2] hadn’t had a style change from its inception. Now it
does.

The theme is pretty minimal. I [forked][3] a repository from [Giulio
Fidente][4] that is spartan black text on white background. Mainly I
just decided to go with square instead of rounded corners on the
buttons and to tighten up the gutter between the sidebar and the main
content.

Along with fixing up the RSS and Atom feeds, the theme change was the
last thing to finish before declaring the transition to static
publishing complete.
