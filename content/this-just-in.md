The Washington Wizards are **still** [truly awful][1]:
> Because going to NBA.com or ESPN.com is too exhausting, here is your one-stop-shop for all your Washington Wizards needs. Not like you’ll need to check whether or not they won or lost any given basketball game they play, but this Twitter account is succinct, efficient, and will probably enjoy very little creativity going forward. Its lone tweet so far:

I attended last night’s game against the Indiana Pacers. As the contest started, I noted that no one on the starting five could actually shoot. Washington promptly went down by 17 points. Despite a spirited rally, the Wiz of course fell short, unable to stop David West, and unable to get a good offensive possession down the stretch.

The scary thought is that the team probably won’t be all that much better when John Wall and Nene come back. Lottery here we come!
