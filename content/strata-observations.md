More Ben Lorica with [some observations][1] coming out of the recent [O’Reilly Strata Conference][2]:
> Here are a few observations based on conversations I had during the just concluded Strata Santa Clara conference.

> **Spark is attracting attention**

> I’ve written numerous times about components of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (Spark, Shark, MLbase). Two Spark-related sessions at Strata were packed (slides here and here) and I talked to many people who were itching to try the BDAS stack. Being able to combine batch, real-time, and interactive analytics in a framework that uses a simple programming model is very attractive. The release of version 0.7 adds a Python API to Spark’s native Scala interface and Java API.

I’m already in the tank for Spark, but Lorica’s got a couple of other interesting observations to add.
