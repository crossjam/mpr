So I hit some pretty important milestones at work and decided to give myself a summer treat. I ordered the hardcover collection [*Howard Chaykin's American Flagg!*][1] from Amazon. A little over a year ago, [this edition hit my radar][3], but I hadn't gotten around to purchasing a copy. Partially because of the price, which was $50 from [the only place I could find it online][2], at the time.

Well Amazon had it for $37. Since I'm an Amazon Prime member, I got it in two days for no extra charge. What's not to like?

The book arrived just a little while ago. And boy does Chaykin's art still look good, even 27 years later. Definitely amped up to revisit Reuben Flagg's (mis)adventures again.
