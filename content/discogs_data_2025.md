You can search this blog and see that I’ve got [a long history][1]
with [Discogs Data Dumps][2]. Over the years, though, it seems that
some glitch would prevent delivery of a dump for a month here or
there. I should do an analysis to illustrate the most recent calendar
year that had a "complete" set of dumps.

The good news is that [2025][3] resulted in captures for all twelve
months. I’ve been monitoring the Discogs discussion forums, and
unfortunately there were [continual data-quality issues][4]. Seems
like they got solved with the latest captures for November and
December. Way to finish strong, Discogs.

Here’s to 2026 being a banner year for Discogs Data Dumps 🤞!
