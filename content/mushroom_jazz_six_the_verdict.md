I think there's been enough listening. Time to render a final judgment.

[*Mushroom Jazz Six*][1] is good, but not great. The mix sustains some of the finest elements of the *Mushroom Jazz* series. Downtempo beats with echoes of house music combined with hip-hop and R&B vocals. As I said before Six incorporates many more jazz elements.

What deflates Six is the last 4 or 5 tracks. While quite jazzy, they also take all the energy out of the ride. The mix doesn't generate any toe tappin' after Mark Farina's *Life* and never rises to another peak. Since this is the last quarter of the album the listener leaves the mix with a blah feeling. Contrast this with *Mushroom Jazzs [Three][4],[Four][6]*, and *[Five][5]*, which all had a late peak then a gentle closing glide.

However, there are some stretches of [*Mushroom Jazz Six*][1] that I really do like. First up:

*    Jamal: *Jamal 141*

* 	Colossus: *Dopebeatz*

*	Brawdcast: *Calm Down (Instrumental)*

*	J-Boogie's Dubtronic Science, Feat. Crown City Rockers: 	*Alive (Instrumental)*

This run is classic Mushroom Jazz. Fat beats. Mellow atmospherics layered on top. A loop snatched from [Tha Alkoholiks](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tha+Alkaholiks) [*Likwit*](http://www.discogs.com/Tha-Alkaholiks-Likwit-Only-When-Im-Drunk/release/334703) pulls it all together. Guaranteed head nodding.

Then a bit later we have:

*  	Rubberoom: *Bodysnatchin' (On The Isle) (Instrumental)*

* 	Flash (13): *Wasn't Really Worth My Time*

* 	Mark Farina: *Life*

Here the energy really picks up. The diva vocals of *Wasn't Really Worth My Time* are a signature of the Mushroom Jazz mixes. The bass of *Life* is really thumpin.

After that though, [*Mushroom Jazz Six*][1] is sort of forgettable. For Mushroom Jazz completists like me, Six is definitely a get. Not a must get, but a get. Don't feel bad if you waited or bought it used. For those new to the series, there are better places to start.
