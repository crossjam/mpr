Title: 2024 Space Telescope Advent

The Atlantic has a nice December feature where they select a space
telescope image ([Hubble][2] or [Webb][3]) each December day from the past
year. They’re all collected in a [2024 Space Telescope Advent Calendar
gallery][1]. The images are always stunning but I have one peeve.

Since they’re all US government media, they’re all essentially in the
public domain (at most liberal Creative Commons). Would it kill The
Atlantic to provide a link back to the original source? Shame on you!

I’m taking matters into my own hands, hunting the sources down, and
stashing them away. I’ll figure out how to get them displayed in a
gallery just because.

And I do mean my own hands, because I see no good way to automate this
process.
