I haven't even seriously flirted with another desktop reader on the Mac, despite a number of emerging alternatives during the heydays of RSS. The only real threat was [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) thanks to its cross-platform nature. But I've always enjoyed a well executed desktop app.

An implicit, but key, selling point was always [Brent Simmons][4], NetNewsWire's politely outspoken and opinionated creator and developer. Brent's been blogging since just about forever, and I've been following him since the Userland Software days. He built brand loyalty through the openness he brought to his development process.

Nothing lasts forever though, and Brent recently engineered [the sale of NetNewsWire][2] to [Black Pixel](http://www.blackpixel.com/), a Seattle Mac indie developer house. I'm hopeful they can uphold, and surpass, the standard Brent set, in the same way [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) has managed to continue on after Brent moved it to RedSweater software.

As usual, [Brent was quite eloquent himself][5] on the big news. Here's another **bravo** from a user who loves the product and appreciates the author.
