At least as of May 2022, here is a brief list of podcasts that I
regularly enjoy. I’ll likely comeback and do individual deeper dives
through the course of the month:

* [The Python Podcast.\_\_init\_\_][1]
* [Data Engineering Podcast][2]
* [Python Bytes][3]
* [Talk Python To Me][4]
* [The Changelog][5]
* [The Data Exchange][6]
* [Kubernetes Podcast From Google][7]
* [Sports Media With Richard Deitsch][8]

Tech heavy. Yup, I’m a nerd. 

Special shout out to [Tobias Macey][10] longtime producer of both the "The Python
Podcast" and the "Data Engineering Podcast" while maintaining a full
time day job and being a dad. Yikes!

Additional shout out to Richard Deitsch’s podcast, recently
discovered, for super high quality journalism about journalism and
media. Usually I don’t enjoy going meta, but Deitsch is **so** good
he’s worth a regular listen. Also check out [his work][9] at The
Athletic. The guy is a beast.
