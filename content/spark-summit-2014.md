This looks like it will be bad timing for me, but as an AMPCamp 2013 and Spark Summit 2013 attendee, I can vouch for the event quality:
> We are proud to announce that the [2014 Spark Summit][1] will be held in San Francisco on June 30 – July 2 at the Westin St. Francis. Tickets are on sale now and can be purchased here.

> For 2014, the Spark Summit has grown to a 3-day event. We’ll have two days of keynotes and presentations followed by one day of hands-on training. Attendees of the summit can choose between a 2-day conference-only pass or a 3-day conference and training pass.

If you can’t/didn’t get to [Strata West 2014][2] this will be your next, best opportunity to get a deep dive into the Spark ecosystem.
