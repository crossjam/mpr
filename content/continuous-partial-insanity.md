Playing off of [continuous partial attention][1], a particularly bad patch of TV convinced me it’s just a medium for “continuous partial insanity". Between The News, “reality shows”, the fictional programming, and the advertising the only intent is to keep you in a state of intense emotional elation or despair. Mostly despair since fear drives sales.

Criminy! Sports is a relative island of rationality, structure, and order.

Interestingly, a Google search for “continuous partial insanity” currently only brings up [a long abandoned blog][2], parked on it as a tagline. Seems like an opportunity.
