Trying to broaden the horizons beyond [io9](http://io9.com) and sites of my fave authors, I've added a few new sites to the subscription pool:

+ [SFSignal](http://www.sfsignal.com/), fan driven and hopefully a little more focused than [io9](http://io9.com)

+ [Locus News](http://scifiwatch.comoj.com/), news from one of the industry's flagships

+ [Locus Roundtable](http://www.locusmag.com/Roundtable/), discussion from a broad selection of "various reviewers, authors, and academics", plus some of the editorial staff

+ [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/), publishers are made out of people!!
