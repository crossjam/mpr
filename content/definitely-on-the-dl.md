Unlike this guy, I’m not seriously [considering dumping the NFL][1], but I’m definitely creeping with The Premiership. And The Champions League. La Liga every now and then. Plus macking on the FA Cup once in a while.

Hey, at least I know Man City is owned by the Sheik who considers money no object to pursuing success.

The best part of world football is that the dang games are done in two hours, guaranteed. Plus the time zone shift means the slate is essentially done by 2 PM Eastern, so you really can’t blow an entire day laying on the couch watching live game action.

Now if I could only get the Bundesliga’s phone number.
