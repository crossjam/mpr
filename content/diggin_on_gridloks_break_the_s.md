The DJ mix part of the album has been in pretty solid rotation.

*Break The System* starts out strong, with an interesting spoken word, futuristic, manifesto regarding humanity needing to "break the system". *Wake Up*, *Bottomfeeder*, and *Watching Us* bring a lot of energy and seem to be working towards a great peak.

Then *Break The System* sort of plateaus. I can't say any of the subsequent tracks are weak, but a little more variation was needed. Also, the initial manifesto was never followed up on thematically, as far as I can tell.

*Infected* is the track that keeps me coming back. I'm a sucker for a really strong close to a mix. However, it would have been great to have this as a mid-mix peak, and then close with something just as strong. Halfway through the listener is "infected" and then by the end he becomes a tool for breaking the system.

Or something like that.

In any event, *Break The System* isn't off the charts great, but it's a good listen.
