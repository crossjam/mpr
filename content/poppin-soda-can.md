Sometimes you just know. 

I’ve only given it two spins on the iPhone, but Mark Farina’s [*Soda Pop Can*][1] edition of the Great Lakes Audio podcast, is the most listenable thing I’ve got my hands on approaching **TWO YEARS!!** The closest recently comparable mix I’ve acquired was Evol Intent’s [*Us Against the World*][2], which I got back in late April of 2011.

*Soda Pop Can* starts out deceptively languorous and down tempo, then maintains pretty close to the same BPM just about all the way throughout. This would typically be a recipe for monotony, but Farina is at the top of his selectin’ game, so the entire mix is an end-to-end toe tapping, head nodder. Peak moment is reserved for K&B’s [*Let’s Stay Together*][4] (*a B-side no less*), promptly followed by Ben La Desh’s hypnotic [*Motion*][5].

One hour, seventeen minutes of pure *house?*, *downtempo*? bliss. 

You… must…download…now!
