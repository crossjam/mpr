Title: TailScale On the Road

So I’ve taken [my iPad][1] out and about, putting TailScale to the test for
remote access to a home machine. Results have been somewhat
mixed. 

First off, that it works at all, making it seamlessly possible to ping
all my devices as if they were on a virtual LAN across the worldwide
Internet, is impressive. I did manage to get some quality extended
remote SSH time on the home machine. I’ve been able to do this
successfully multiple times.

**But** for whatever reason, on one of my trips things went really
sideways. Don’t know what happened but I lost access, maybe it was the
café Wi-Fi connectivity, and then TailScale was a bit out of
sorts. Couldn’t resolve hosts using TailScale DNS for a few moments,
then when resolution came back, couldn’t complete connections. I
switched to my phone as a mobile hotspot and things were still a bit
borked. Quite a bit of teasing potential for a full recovery, but
things just never got right. Finally just gave up and went back home.

I’m freely admitting not doing any serious diagnosis, so please
TailScale support, no need to ring my number. I’ll be a good customer
and attempt an appropriate bug report if it happens again.
