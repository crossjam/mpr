The latter's somewhat charming, but doesn’t quite feed the need. 

What’s a former [illycaffè][2] barista to do? At home, I could do a standard drip brewer, or a French press, or even a small espresso machine. But all of those are too inconvenient. When I’m at home and feel the urge, I don’t need top of the line java, just something to meet the craving.

So I bought a [Keurig B70 Platinum K-Cup coffee brewer][1] this past weekend. The Keurig scratches the itch when I get a few free moments at home to read, or hack, or just stargaze. Doing that in a public place with interesting foot traffic? That'll have to wait until our next abode.
