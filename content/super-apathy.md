Superbowl XLVI is today. I have to say I've become increasingly disinterested in the event. The actual game is appointment television, but the two week buildup, the pregame, the partying, the halftime show, etc. etc. do nothing for me. I’ve taken to tuning in as close to kickoff as possible, even missing up to the first five minutes of the game. Only got burned on Devin Hester's opening kickoff return, ’natch.

I'd like to think it's age and maturity. Could just be familiarity and cynicism.

Okay, with the right people I can be interested in partying, but I'm just sayin’.
