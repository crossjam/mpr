Oh that must mean **VICTORY**! It was big scoring, for a bye week, but not a big victory. Then again, I was essentially a man down, what with Minnesota as my DEF delivering a -1 on the scorebook. Yes, I would have been better off with an empty spot.

Still won with a comfortable 9 point spread. I'll give myself a GM pat on the back for picking up the Giant's Ahmad Bradshaw. Loving his three TDs. Aaron Rodgers met expectations while Buffalo's Fred Jackson doubled up his projection. After that it was a bunch of mediocre performances.

My opponent must be wondering how he lost. He had the second highest score in the league this week. And the opposing team spotted him a point, and then effectively played 7 guys versus his 8. We were both expecting a track meet between Dallas and New England, but he was hurt worse when a defensive struggle broke out. On my sidle Miles Austin and Jason Witten were solid, but on the other side Tom Brady and Wes Welker were significantly down. But enough of him, I'm enjoying a win.

Holding down the playoffs in fourth position. Now can I put together back to back victories?
