The JBeez, for short, were an offshoot of the late 80's/early 90's [Native Tongues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongues_Posse) hip-hop collective. Not quite reaching the same level of renown as [A Tribe Called Quest](http://www.discogs.com/artist/A+Tribe+Called+Quest) or [De La Soul](http://www.discogs.com/artist/De+La+Soul), looking back they had a pretty productive oeuvre.

Apropos, [Elle Driver](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001804/): *"You know I've always liked that word... 'oeuvre' ... so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence."*

Some highlights:

* *Jimbrowski*, their debut, "the thing's so big you need a U-haul to haul it"

* *Because I Got It Like That*, the 12" followup if I remember correctly

* *JBeez Coming Through*, "5000 boomin watts. Sound system state of the art"

* *Black is Black*, especially the [Gee Street Ultrablack mix](http://www.discogs.com/Jungle-Brothers-Black-Is-Black/release/1259284)

* *I'll House You*, A House music anthem to this day, "feel the vibe, **feel the vibe**, feel the bass, c'mon!"

What's great about all of these tracks is that the beats, rhymes, and energy still hold up well today. For a 1.5 album group, their sophomore effort [*Done By The Forces of Nature*](http://www.discogs.com/Jungle-Brothers-Done-By-The-Forces-Of-Nature/release/68600) was a little weak, the JBeez got a lot done.
