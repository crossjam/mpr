Quoting Lucas Gonze, who’s always been a good read. Might be worth a sub:
>  I'm blogging about new form factors for computing on a Tumblr blog at [formfactor.gonze.com][1]. My topic there is post-mobile contexts like biohacking, head mounted displays, wearable computing, smart TV, haptics, and neural interfaces. The subtext is new applications enabled by changes in the physical shape of devices.
