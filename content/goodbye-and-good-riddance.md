Friday, July 13th, glad to see you go. Seems like every single complex system (natural or man made) decided to spend the day frustrating me. From organizational BS, to proposal rejections, to IT failures (special honors to MS Outlook 2007), to traffic, to kids just doing what they do, frustration abounded. 

Well your worst has been done and no catastrophes occurred. Sayanora!
