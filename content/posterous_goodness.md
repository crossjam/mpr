Setting up a new [posterous][2] blog and adding a custom domain name, under my control, only took about 20 minutes. The majority of the time was spent trying to figure out if I could have a domain name that starts with digits.  Turns out you can. Defining and assigning the custom domain was a piece of cake.

My [100 Hours Project][1] site is now live. I'm going to use it as a linkblog and thoughtspace for [my off hours hacking projects][3]. Not to mention as a place to experiment with posterous.

**Bonus**, Not that I'm a big Facebook poster, but posterous seems to have fixed their [Facebook autoposting][4]. Now I can hit Facebook and Twitter with one swell foop.
