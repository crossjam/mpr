I'd like to think I'm immune to heavy doses of advertising, but every now and then there's a TV commercial that really captures my fancy. Recently Heineken has been carpet bombing the NBA playoffs with one advertisement, [*The Entrance*][1]. For whatever reason, it's really stuck with me.

Part of it is of course the music, [*The Golden Age*][3], by The Asteroids Galaxy Tour. Like the lead singer, and the lyrics are actually interesting. 

Another bit of fascination for me is the number of different versions. On TV I got hooked on [the "extended" version of *The Entrance*][2], that's about 1:32 in length. Currently on TV it's running in a shortened 30 second version, which I find irritating since it leaves out a lot of nuance. *Wait! I thought he had a flute at the end?!* But digging around on the interwebs, I found the really extended 3:00 minute version, embedded above, which provides a lot of back story. If you believe a commercial can have back story. Oddly enough, at the end of the 3 minute version, he's got the flute, but not the Heineken.

Like I said, it's a guilty pleasure.
