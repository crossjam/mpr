I liken the experience to [reading Charlie Stross' *Accelerando*][2]: an intense flood of ideas. However, *Rainbows End* is not as frenetic as *Accelerando* and much less Singularity focused, making it a bit more on a human scale. Still the technology extrapolations come fast and furious.

Still puzzling out my feelings about the book. I guess I sort of admire Vinge's vision and ideas, but I never really connected deeply to the work.

I guess *Rainbows End* gets a hearty shrug from this reader.
