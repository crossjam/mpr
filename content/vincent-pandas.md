Two great tastes, that [taste great together][1]:
> The Pandas Time Series/Date tools and Vega visualizations are a great match; Pandas does the heavy lifting of manipulating the data, and the Vega backend creates nicely formatted axes and plots. Vincent is the glue that makes the two play nice, and provides a number of conveniences for making plot building simple.

Useful examples ensue.
