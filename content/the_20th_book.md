As a New Year's resolution, I set out to read more books. Managing to keep up with that resolution, I'm up to my 20th for the year. Maybe Neal Stephenson's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a> wasn't such a good choice for number 20 though.

Don't get me wrong, it's good stuff which I've read before. But 1130 pages of historical fiction cum cryptotechno thriller, would slow anyone's momentum. I went through July on a roll, plowing through about 6 books, thanks to some extended leisure time around the 4th of July. It may take me all of August to finish Cryptonomicon.

We forge on.
