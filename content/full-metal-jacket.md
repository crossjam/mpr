Despite the commercials, forgot how damn good, and twisted, a film it is. [*Apocalypse Now, Redux*][1] best captures what I know (being of the generation after) the fucked-upness of the Vientam war. And it's just a better movie.

But *Full Metal Jacket* is a straight up mind fuck. War is hell. Must be that Jungian thing.
