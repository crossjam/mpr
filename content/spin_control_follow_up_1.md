Apparently Chris Moriarty, the author of the [excellent](http://crossjam.net/mpr/2009/01/the-9th-book-spin-control.html) [*Spin Control*][1], started a [blog](http://chrismoriartysciencefiction.blogspot.com/). Looks like its gone dark, but I didn't know that [*Spin Control*][1] had won the 2006 Philip K. Dick award.

At least I know I have some SF taste. And [the list of past winners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_k_dick_award) is probably a good seed for feature reading.
