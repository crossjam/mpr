In my past life, I had a somewhat unnatural, and prescient if I do say so myself, [interest in the intersection of technology and journalism][2]. I would even hang out with ink stained wretches on a routine basis and help train up a few on that ’thar new bloggin’ thang.

I had enough pull to get invitations extended to various people doing cool things at the Lawrence  Journal-World in Manhattan, Kansas. This included one [Adrian Holovaty](http://holovaty.com), principal instigator of the [Django](http://djangoproject.com) web development platform, née content management system. Of course when he came to Northwestern I enjoyed having a <del>needy</del> **nerdy** chat. *Curse you autocorrect!*

We never got synch up on any interesting projects, but he went on to do some nice work with The Washington Post and launch the highly impactful [EveryBlock](http://www.everyblock.com/). Now [Adrian’s moving on][1] to pastures TBD. EveryBlock and Django, not bad for a developer’s career and I’m sure he’s got plenty left in the tank. 

Good luck buddy!
