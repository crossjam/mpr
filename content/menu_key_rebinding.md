In my quest to propagate Google Reader key bindings to all my feed readers, I discovered that you can [rebind the keys for menu items][2] in MacOS X. Caius Theory had [the initial tip off][1] when I was looking to get NetNewsWire to emulate Google Reader. Don't quite know if NetNewsWire has the menu functions that can actually make this happen, but the capability is a neat little feature of MacOS.
