Speaking of Python, I never knew Intel had [their own custom, performance supercharged version][1]:
> The Intel® Distribution for Python* is an easy-to-access, integrated package that delivers faster Python* application performance on modern Intel® platforms. Available for Windows*, Linux* and macOS*.

Those stars are for a link to [the varied trademarks][2]. Gotta love those big corporate lawyers. That’s probably also why you have to go through an annoying registration form to download the bundle.
