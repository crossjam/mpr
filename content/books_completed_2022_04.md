Title: 2022 Books Completed, Part 4
Author: C. Ross Jam

Date: 2022-09-25

It’s been a minute, or two, since we’ve done this. From May to August
15 titles were closed out. That’ll take this year’s total to 25. 40
finished is conceivable. 

Lots to get to. Let’s get stuck in.

_2022-10-04 Now with even more commentary._

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->


### May

* [_A Memory Called Empire_][1], Arkady Marine
* [_Let’s Talk_][2], Therese Huston

_...Empire..._ was an entertaining space opera / mystery. Glad I read
it, but wasn’t an epiphany for me.

_Let’s Talk_ didn’t have any one thing about giving workplace feedback
that stuck out for me. If I’m ever back in an environment where
there’s a more formal process, I’ll definitely use it as a resource.

### June

* [_Think Again_][3], Adam Grant
* [_Positive Intelligence_][4], Shirzad Chamine
* [_Klara and The Sun_][5], Kazuo Ishiguro

_Think Again_ started off annoying me with too much proof by anecdote,
but eventually I came around to some of the principles of productively
challenging assumptions.

_Positive Intelligence_ took me a while to finish because I had to
take breaks from the overwhelming Silicon Valley Spiritualism (TM)
slathered on some useful cognitive foundations.

The highly regarded _Klara and The Sun_ is admirably well written,
exemplified by the opening paragraph, which says so much with so
few words. Subtly deep on so many levels and another example of
speculative fiction that isn’t fueled by extreme conflict and
violence. Probably deserves a reread for full appreciation.

### July

* [_UNIX: A History and a Memoir_][6], Brian Kernighan
* [_The Road to Unfreedom_][7], Timothy Snyder
* [_The E-Myth Revisited_][8], Michael E. Gerber
* [_Altered Carbon: Download Blues_][9], Richard K. Morgan

_UNIX_ does what it says on the tin, but for us old-time UNIXers there
were just lots of entertaining little nuggets on the environment
within Bell Labs, sort of a nerd holy land, during the time UNIX was
created.

[Brittney Griner’s][16] detention in Russia prompted me to venture out
and understand what’s going in the former USSR. _...Unfreedom..._ had
been on the to-read list and delivered. Snyder’s distinction between
the politics of eternity and of inevitability resonates on a number of
levels. 

Forgot to add a thought on _The E-Myth..._. Just picked it up as a
deal from Amazon Kindle, hoping to learn more about why small
businesses fail. Turned out to be a bit on the business fable side,
while definitely sneakily sales pitch oriented towards the author’s seminars.
I did find the notion to make your business franchisable useful in
engaging the business from a systematic perspective instead of via an
emotional attachment. Key phrase: "working **on** the business versus
working **in** the business"

I love Richard K. Morgan’s Takeshi Kovacs novels and was looking
forward to reading the _...Download Blues..._ graphic novel. A ho-hum
result as the art wasn’t outstanding and word balloons don’t provide
quite enough text to match Morgan’s prose. Someone with a really
strong and distinctive visual style might be able to make something of
the Kovacs ethos but they’d have go way out on a limb to get me excited.

### August

* [_Hope In the Dark_][10], Rebecca Solnit
* [_On Tyranny_][11], Timothy Snyder
* [_Twilight of Democracy_][12], Anne Applebaum
* [_How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism_][13], Cory Doctrow
* [_Team Human_][14], Douglas Rushkoff
* [_This is How You Lose the Time War_][15], Amal El-Mohtar and Max
  Gladstone
  
_Hope In The Dark_, even though a bit dated, is a reminder that
progressive activism can actually change the world, despite the
current waves of cynicism and nihilism washing over it.

_On Tyranny_ is a short pamphlet with discrete points on how one can
live in a principled fashion with authoritarianism on the rise. Just
having basic human decency is step one.

In a similar theme, _Twilight of Democracy_ chronicles how
anti-democratic politics, culture, and cognitive warfare are spreading
from Central Europe throughout the rest of the world.

_...Surveillance Capitalism..._ reads like a stapled together
collection of blog posts, but has a couple of solid ideas. First, Big
Tech doesn’t have any mind-control rays and their products are
probably a bit overrated. Second, the notion of consumer harm in
anti-trust policy has negatively tilted the corporate playing field
towards monopoly across a number of markets and especially
tech. Monopolies are typically not a good thing.

_Team Human_ is Douglas Rushkoff’s examination of how global humanity
might survive its current wicked problems. More technology and more
capitalism probably won’t get it done.

El-Mohtar and Gladstone’s novella is interestingly constructed as a
series of alternating competitive exchanges and letters between time
traveling rivals. The writing is achingly beautiful in moments and I
thoroughly enjoyed the story.
