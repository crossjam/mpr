Like the additions, although a quick and dirty test-drive of [Multicorn][2] failed miserably for me. Trying to build the sample application actually crashed the `postgres` db server, which is pretty tough to do. Probably some embedded Python and dynamic library badness, but still. Maybe I just need to go back and be a little careful about my build.
