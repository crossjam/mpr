Odd week? Must be a loss for the Plexus Rangers. 79 fantasy points for. 146 against. And I thought [Man U had it bad this weekend][1].

I picked up Earnest Graham, who continued the injury streak by going down with a season ending knee/ankle injury after 16 yards gained. At least I dumped Santana Moss for Graham. Moss is now out 4-5 weeks with a broken hand. And here I was seriously considering picking up DeMarco Murray and his 251 yard performance. 

Miles Austin chipped in a lousy 2.5 points. Rob Bironas scored a single lonely extra point. Larry Fitzgerald failed to make it to the end zone. At least Aaron Rodgers hit for his regular 25+ points.

My opponent must be pissed he wasted such a great outing on such a feeble opponent. He played both Drew Brees for 40 fantasy points, and Arian Foster for 43 more.  That's right. Two of his players outscored **my whole entire lineup**.

Onward to next week.
