I <em>work</em> smack in the middle of the DC Metro area, typically ensconced in a lovely office building in the Ballston section of Arlington, VA. I <em>live</em> at the margins of "DC", way out in Loudoun County, VA, not too far from the West "By God" Virginia border. Don't ask.

Despite growing up 20 years ago in Frederick County, MD, and moving back to DC about 2 years ago, I'm still not into the tempo of the city.

<a href="http://dcblogs.com/index.php">DC Blogs</a> is helping to fix that. I'm enjoying the <a href="http://dcblogs.com/?feed=rss2"><em>DC Blogs Noted</em> feed</a>, which serves reasonable tapas-style portions of DC themed blogs on a daily basis. The editors have a fine sensibility and the blurb writing that goes along with each linked post is exquisite. They also have an aggregator, <a href="http://dcblogs.com/index.php?page_id=299"><em>DC Blogs Live</em></a>, which looks like it might be a bit of a firehose. Not quite ready to jump into that yet.

In any event, good on ya <a href="http://dcblogs.com/index.php">DC Blogs</a>.
