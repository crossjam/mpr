Regarding [Chrome and 1Password][1], I'm using the combination increasingly and things seem to be going fine. One minor nit is that 1Password can't seem to autologin. It'll fill in the username and password fields, but won't hit the login button. Not a big deal.

On that [Mac OS X DNS issue][2], so far so good. Haven't seen my machine get confused about local IP addresses over the past week.

[Choosy][3] is [not seeing much use][4]. Might be slated for removal.
