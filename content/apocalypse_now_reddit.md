You need to know a few things to interpret the presence of the following screen capture, [from a Reddit discussion][4], on this blog.

1. [*_why, the lucky stiff*][3], was a popular Internet persona from the community of programmers that use the Ruby programming language. He had a very theatrical and artistic style that could be inspiring, confusing, or off putting. Recently he disappeared, wiping out all of his online work. Subsequently he was the subject of a number of [eulogies][2], a few of which appeared on on the social news site Reddit. Many people objected.

2. I am a bit of a nut for Francis Ford Coppola's [*Apocalypse Now*][1].

3. I have a hacker's sense of humor
