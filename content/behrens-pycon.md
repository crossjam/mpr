[Shannon -jj Behrens][4] is doing a great job [summarizing a number of the PycCon talks][1].

I especially like [his summary][2] of [Ned Batchelder's Pragmatic Unicode][3] talk. I agree with him that it was on of the best talks of the conference. Despite my limited attendance, we had quite a bit of overlap in session attendance. Maybe that's an indicator I have good Python taste ;-/
