The [call for papers for ICWSM][1], the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, 2013 is out. I’ve been a reviewer and attendee in the past and may actually be able to submit something this year. Yeah!!

But, according to Danah Boyd there might have been [a bit of a botch][2]:
> In the end, I found that there was such extensive miscommunication that the gulf between what I had stated upfront as being key to me running the conference was miles away from what AAAI would find acceptable. Both of us felt as though we were contorting ourselves to make this work and it left both of us very bitter and unable to work with one another. I decided that I could not run a conference that wasn’t accessible to many of the core parts of my research community just to please other parts of the research community. I felt trapped and realized that it would be better to walk away than to let go of my principles.

Boooo!!
