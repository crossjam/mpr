Since I've been overdosing on [*The Dark Knight* movie][7] (*thanks to HBO On Demand*), I thought I'd revisit some of the film's inspiration. To wit I've signed out from the library:

1. [*Batman: Year One*][5], Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli
2. [*Batman: The Long Halloween*][4], Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale
3. [*The Killing Joke*][3], Alan Moore and Brian Bolland
4. [*The Dark Knight Returns*][1], Frank Miller

I'm going for one big inhale of Batman mythos.

I was lucky enough to buy first run copies of [*The Dark Knight Returns*][1] (the actual 4 book series) and *The Killing Joke* as a teenager, but I dropped out of collecting comic books well over 15 years ago. So I'm no expert on what constitutes a canon of Batman graphic novels. I'm confident that these four would wind up in the discussion. Hilary Goldstein, of IGN, has all four in the top five of her [*25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels.*][6]

I'm salivating even as I write this.
