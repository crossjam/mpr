Searching my archives, looks like I first encountered [pygame][1] over
[16 years ago][5] 😲! pygame subsequently served me well for experimenting
with generative art in Python.

Back in 2023, [a post from Diego Crespo][2], about drama in the pygame
community, came across my transom.

At the time, I duly noted the occurrence but was off doing other
things and didn’t take any action.

However, with the benefit of improvements in the Python ecosystem and
my own abilities, I’m contemplating revisiting my _ancient_ [peyote
repository][3] for generative art noodling. [pygame Community Edition
(Pygame-ce)][4] seems to have a lively community that’s keeping pygame
up to date with the changes in Python.

It’ll definitely have to be part of the next steps.
