Java is about as far as I'm willing to descend into systems level programming these days.

The Barbarian Group's [Cinder][1] is actually tempting enough to make me reconsider.  Cinder is a C++ framework for creative coding, ala [processing](http://processing.org). From the project's [About page][3]:

<blockquote><em>

CINDER PROVIDES A POWERFUL, INTUITIVE TOOLBOX for programming graphics, audio, video, networking, image processing and computational geometry. Cinder is cross-platform, and in general the exact same code works under Mac OS X, Windows and a growing list of other platforms — most recently the iPhone and iPad.

</em></blockquote>

[CreativeApplications.net](http://creativeapplications.net) also has [a good summary of Cinder's capabilities][2], with a nice gallery of sample projects.
