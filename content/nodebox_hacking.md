Functionally, I think I've got an implementation that's pretty close to an equivalent. Unfortunately, it lacks a little in the performance department.

I so want to play blame low level pixel twiddling and bit blitting in NodeBox, but really need to more carefully investigate. There's one or two other potential culprits.

But this is turning into a fun little side project.
