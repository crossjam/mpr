It feels like more than [eight years][1] though, maybe because [I’ve been all over it][2] since the beginning:

> We launched Amazon S3 on March 14, 2006 with a press release and a simple blog post. We knew that the developer community was interested in and hungry for powerful, scalable, and useful web services and we were eager to see how they would respond.

Of course, I was dead wrong in my analysis. *“S3 is not a gamechanger.”* What was I thinking? Too much focus on the storage economics and not enough on the business model inflection point.
