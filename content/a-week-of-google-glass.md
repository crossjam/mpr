Luke Wroblewski takes interface design and user experience in a serious fashion. So [his Google Glass experience][1] was the first commentary I took seriously:
> Almost a week ago I picked up my Glass explorer edition on Google’s campus in Mountain View. Since then I’ve it put into real-world use in a variety of places. I wore the device in three different airports, busy city streets, several restaurants, a secure federal building, and even a casino floor in Las Vegas. My goal was to try out Glass in as many different situations as possible to see how I would or could use the device.

> During that time, Scott Jenson’s concise mandate of user experience came to mind a lot. As Scott puts it “value must be greater than pain.” That is, in order for someone to use a product, it must be more valuable to them than the effort required to use it. Create enough value and pain can be high. But if you don’t create a lot of value, the pain of using something has to be really low. It’s through this lens, that I can best describe Google Glass in it’s current state.

Definitely worth a full read, especially for the punch line.
