The weather's starting to turn from Winter to Summer *(no, there's no Spring in Chicago)*. "Wait until next year," is not yet applicable to either the Cubs or Sox. And if you're lucky, playoffs in the NBA or NHL.

I was lucky enough to arrive in Chicago at the tail end of the Bulls second threepeat. The Cubs Bartman catastrophe was tragic, but I felt the full impact of [the Curse of the Billy Goat][2]. I got to experience the 2005 White Sox World Series run. While I was cutting out of town, headed for DC, during the Bears 2006-07 Super Bowl run, there were a couple of NFL playoff disappointments thrown in.

The great thing about playoffs in Chicago is that every day feels like either party time, on game day, or party eve, on the off days. When the game is on, if you don't have a ticket you stroll up to your favorite watering hole, grab a stool, and cheer for the home team.

I'd love to be out there rubbing shoulders with [Blackhawks][1] fans during this year's Stanley Cup run.
