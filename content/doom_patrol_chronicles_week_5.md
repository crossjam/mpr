My teams went 3-1 this week. Both Yahoo! league teams won and are still leading or near the lead of the leagues. Out of 10 games they have one loss between them. This was also one of the more hazardous weeks, because both of their #1 quarterbacks, New Orleans' Drew Brees and Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers, were on bye. Now a prime scoring position is locked in, barring injury as they say.

The ESPN league team rolled to a victory. Houston's Andre Johnson finally had a really big day and I got a surprisingly productive performance out of New York's Ahmad Bradshaw. Arizona's Anquan Boldin is starting to make me nervous, especially since I turned down a trade for him. Let's see if I can eke out back-to-back wins with this team.

I'm embarrased to say I lost my NFL.com game against an owner who started two players on bye. My team had some insanely poor underperformers including the Browns' Jerome Harrison, the Colts' Pierre Garcon, and the Jaguars' Mike Sims-Wakler. Worse, I had enough points on the bench to win this game.

Still fiending for that undefeated week.
