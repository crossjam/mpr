Okay, [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com/blog) has been better than I expected, with lots of little tips that can greatly improve one’s Emacs utility, such as:

> I’m fond of seeing [somewhere the full path to the file][1] I’m currently editing(as opposed to just the file name displayed in modeline). Emacs’s frame title seems like a good place to display such information, since by default it doesn’t show anything interesting. Here’s how we can achieve this:

and:

> Emacs does not have [a command backward-kill-line ][2](which would kill the text from the point to the beginning of the line), but it doesn’t really need one anyways. Why so? Simple enough - invoking kill-line with a prefix argument 0 does exactly the same thing!

At least one good nugget per day.
