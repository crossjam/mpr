ArsTechnica, which is fairly reputable, reports that [15" MacBook Pros seem to be in short supply][1]:

> *“15" MacBook Pros are starting to become scarce among popular resellers, suggesting an Ivy Bridge update could be coming as soon as the end of April. Users hoping for updated 13" and possibly 17" models will likely have to wait until at least June, however.”*

Touting an April 29th announcement for new 15-inchers is getting my hopes up. However, I’m not sure “slimmer … sans optical drive” definitely means MacBook Air slim, which is what I’m really fiending for.

And 8GB Ram.

And 512GB SSD for a reasonable price.

A man can dream can’t he.
