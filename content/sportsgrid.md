[SportsGrid](http://sportsgrid.com) looks like a conveniently timed sports feed replacement since [I deadpooled DeadSpin][2].

*Via [Michael Sippey][1]*, who called SportsGrid: "ESPN meets The Awl."

<blockquote><em>

Our goal is a simple one: to cover the culture of sports and entertainment, as well as the media personalities who talk and write about it, in a fun, compelling and easy to consume way. Perhaps more importantly, we also aim to objectively rank the legions of participants of our favorite pastimes by tracking who is – at any given moment – receiving the most “buzz” from his or her actions on and off the field.

From what I've read so far, I like the coverage. The stories are actually intellignet reporting and opinion, without being more of the sports same old, same old. Or dry statistical overanalysis. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

The "buzz" and ranking stuff is a gimmick. Seriously, who needs a hype index for NFL coaches? But it's probably paying the bills.
