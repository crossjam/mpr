Link parkin’: [RethinkDB][1]
> RethinkDB is built to store JSON documents, and scale to multiple machines with very little effort. It has a pleasant query language that supports really useful queries like table joins and group by, and is easy to setup and learn.

Could this be the document oriented DB that [MongoDB][2] could *(should?)* have been?
