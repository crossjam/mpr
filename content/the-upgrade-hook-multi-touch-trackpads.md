So after a few days of using Lion on an older, white MacBook I've realized that the [multi-touch trackpads][1] are probably core to getting the most out of Lion. Even though I don't have access to a machine with a trackpad and Lion *(foo on slow upgrade processes at work)* I'm sure there are [some gestures][3] you just can't make on the old trackpads. 

Of course that's a big nudge to upgrade to more recent models. [Rumored][2] 15" MacBook Airish machines would make a nice Christmas self-present.
