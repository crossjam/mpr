Title: Transplanted
Slug: transplanted

_Yet another left behind in the drafts bin from June 2020. Including
today for posterity’s sake._

This is my first post using Markdown and [Pelican][1]. Currently
<https://crossjam.net/> is resolving properly and the content has
transferred over. There's a bunch of redirects, which are a little
ugly, but they serve the purpose of dealing with the old WordPress
path prefixes. [Mass Programming Resistance][2] and [New Media
Hack][3] *(still preserved, bless its heart)* are separated out into
two different domains.

Now need to work on a good workflow for publishing. The upside is that I can now
go with Emacs to create posts, which will accelerate my ability to spit out
text. But I'll need some key bindings to smooth out some of the linking
work. Also, need to figure out a comfortable flow to update the production
server. Pushing to a git repo seems like a little too much work, although
[netlify](https://www.netlify.com) has an interesting take on that path. Maybe
for a dev site just to get some experience.
