Well now I don't have to feel so guilty about wanting to see another Tom Cruise mega-action sequel.

First you'll note the red circle in the screen capture on the right. With [*The Dark Knight Rises*][3] now on the horizon, [(witness the latest trailer *link to QuickTime)*][6], getting 6 minutes of Chris Nolan's upcoming vision can make just about any movie worthwhile. My guess is that the prologue goes back to some confluence of beginnings for Batman, Ra's Al Ghul, and Bane. I'll be interested to see if there are any influences from Frank Miller's [*The Dark Knight Returns*][7] in *The Dark Knight Rises* or whether that's grist for a fourth film.

Even better is that's a capture from the [Udvar-Hazy Theater][4] website. That's the IMAX(**real IMAX**) venue right around the corner from me. I'm betting on [another fabulous experience seeing a movie][5] there.
