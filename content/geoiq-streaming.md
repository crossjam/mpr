Love their browser based mapping products, and even snuck a few maps into some projects. Failed to ever ignite a larger project, but there's still hope.

Thanks to an [Andy Hickl](https://twitter.com/#!/andyhickl) [retweet][2], I got wind of [GeoIQ's streaming data features][1]. The capability for real-time ingest of data and updates to maps was something I was really looking for in my work projects. Congrats to the GeoIQ team!

Now that I've got a pile of geo-tagged data, I might try and test drive the features on [GeoCommons](http://www.geocommons.com) as a hobby project. [Chris Helm][3] also does a great job of going a layer down and highlighting the tech GeoIQ is using to implement this capability. Hmmm, a vote on the positive side of the ledger for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org).
