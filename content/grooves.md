You know you're in a reading groove, when you finish a book you don't like, but have the urge to start another one right away. And you have one you'll like immediately handy.

You know you're in a blogging groove, when daily posting is almost effortless. Sure they're not all high content or essay long, but it's the habit that counts.

Of course habits like these are fragile and need to be constantly nurtured.

An exploding picture tube on your ancient TV is quite handy. As well as the discipline not to instantaneously run out and buy some new flat panel.
