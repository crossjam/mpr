That was a great [2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game][1]. I really thought Butler was going to be crushed due to Duke's size, but the Bulldog's defense was surprisingly effective. I've been watching Final Fours since 1977 and the two Butler games rank right up there for drama. Yeah, Butler was highly ranked to start the year, but they were still underdogs.

All I can say is that they are as good as advertised. Maya Moore is a stone cold assassin. I'm actually stoked to watch the ladies championship because it will be historic either way. *(As of this writing UConn is ice cold, and Stanford's not looking scared.)*

Mark my words, if UConn wins their 78th game in a row, and second championship in a row, they'll reach 100 in a row.
