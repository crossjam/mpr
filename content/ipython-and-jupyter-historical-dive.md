Some folks conflate [IPython][4] and [Jupyter][3] in casual conversation, but the projects have had distinctly different paths. Karlijn Willems did [a deep dive][1] into the differences and even got some feedback and input from the creators:

> Today’s blog post intends to illustrate some of the core differences between the two more explicitly, not only starting from the origins of both to explain how the two relate, but also covering some specific features that are either part of one or the other, so that it will be easier for you to make the distinction between the two!

> Consider also reading [DataCamp’s Definitive Guide to Jupyter Notebook][2] for tips and tricks, best practices, examples, and much more.

There are definitely some interesting twists and turns.
