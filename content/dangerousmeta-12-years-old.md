Gotta give a shout out to Garret P Vreeland's [dangerousmeta weblog](http://dangerousmeta.com), which recently turned [12 years old][1]. As a longtime follower (I go back to the [EditThisPage][3] days) I have to say Vreeland is one of the few firehose weblogs I've managed to tolerate over the years. That dude can spew! And if I could [type 120 WPM][2], I might crank out as many posts as Vreeland does on a daily basis, although I'm more impressed that he actually reads all the stuff he links to (no retweets here) before posting about it. 

I don't follow through on 10% of what he points to, but I've genuinely enjoyed his eclectic mix of culture, politics, technology, and New Mexico. Hopefully he doesn't mind me cribbing his logo for some visual spice. Shoot me an e-mail if there's a problem. And here's hoping to another 12 good blogging years.
