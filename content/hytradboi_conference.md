This looks like an interesting set of presentations:
["Have You Tried Rubbing A Database On It?"][1]

> HYTRADBOI was a day of lightning talks about turning a data-centric
> lens onto familiar problems to yield strange new solutions (and
> maybe exciting new problems). Talks ranged from wild ideas and
> unlikely experiments to cutting-edge research and production war
> stories.

Being loosely affiliated with the [Berkeley Computer Systems Mafia
(TM)][5] the general theme of "let’s talk intersection of data
management and everything else," is near and dear to my heart. Gotta
give a shout out to [CIDR][6] as an analog, but strictly from the
academic R&D perspective. And definitely without the radical format
experiment!

Really useful [background information][3] and conference
[postmortem][4] 


**Background**

> Fundamentally, every computer system is about storing, moving and
> transforming data. The line between operating system, database and
> programming language is somewhat arbitrary - a product of specific
> problems, available hardware and historical accident.

> But today the problems and the hardware have changed dramatically,
> and as a result we're starting to see people experimenting with
> redrawing the lines.

**Postmortem**

> A lot of people expressed a surprising amount of support for the
> conference. I think there is a lot of pent up demand for a database
> conference that isn't just SaaS ads. That support meant that people
> were very willing to help promote the conference and were forgiving
> of the many technical issues. Many people bought tickets knowing
> that they wouldn't be able to attend, because they wanted something
> like this to exist.
