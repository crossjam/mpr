[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Thunderbird Logo.jpg" alt="Thunderbird Logo.jpg" border="0" width="75" height="80" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][3] The [Thunderbird][3] dock icon in Mac OS X shows a count. Of what, I'm not sure. But the count doesn't jibe with what I expect, that being the number of unread messages in my Inbox. It's unclear whether this is [a bug or poorly understood default][1], but it's driving me up a wall.

I'm desperate enough to give a [Thunderbird 3 beta][2] a test drive.
