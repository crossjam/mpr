As a tabaholic, maybe the [OneTab][1] plug-in can help with my addiction. It might also get me back on Chrome more regularly although really my main issue is the inconsistent behavior of the 1Password extension.
> Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.

> When your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save up to 95% of memory because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in Google Chrome.
