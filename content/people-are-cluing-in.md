The Basketball Jones [discovers][1] that our Wiz don’t *completely* suck:

> Over the last few weeks, though, there’s been life, legitimate life out of DC. Not only did they win five straight at home, but they beat a handful of pretty good teams — the Thunder, Hawks and the previously mentioned Bulls on that Saturday-nighter — and absolutely ran a couple lousy ones off the court, destroying the Magic 120-91, and drubbing the Timberwolves 114-101 in a game that wasn’t even as close as the final score indicated. Even on their five-game West Coast road trip in between home stints, they went a respectable 2-3, beating two solid teams in the Nuggets and Blazers, and not losing any game by more than seven points. The improvement from the team that started 4-28 was evident, to say the least.

But as of this writing, at the end of the third quarter, Andrew’s ’76ers are in good position. Wiz with 63 lousy points.

Even worse, Nick Young is having a good revenge game, although it’s still “good bye, good riddance”.
