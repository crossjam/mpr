Really enjoyed a recent Architecht Show podcast interview about co-design of hardware and software to improve task performance. Feels like computing is getting close to “software defined everything,” which provides lots of opportunity to build optimized cross-layer stacks. 

> In this [episode of the ARCHITECHT AI Show][1], Hillery Hunter—IBM Fellow and director of the Accelerated Cognitive Infrastructure group at IBM Research—speaks about the state of the art in deep learning systems design. She discusses some record-breaking results that IBM recently achieved in distributed deep learning; ideal use cases for state-of-the-art image recognition; and the pros, cons and advancements in everything from GPUs to cloud-specific hardware such as Google's TPUs.

Hillery Hunter comes through as a really sharp cookie, while cleanly and clearly expressing the impact of her team’s results.
