So the Amazon MP3 Store just put one on the board against the iTMS. Here's what I picked up today from AzMP3:

* House of Pain, [*Jump Around*][1]

* EPMD, [*You're A Customer*][2]

* Big Daddy Kane, [*RAW*][4], [*Ain't No Half Steppin*][3], [*Set It Off*][5]

* Marley Marl, [*The Symphony*][6]

* MC Shan, [*The Bridge*][7]

* Souls of Mischief, [*That's When Ya Lost*][8]

The only track the iTMS had was [*Jump Around*][1], and for $1.29 at that. Everything was $0.99 on AzMP3. Screw variable pricing.
