* Upgrading from the Dashboard. Earlier this week I upgraded my installation with one click. This WordPress [release][2] was a security update so ease of keeping up to date is commendable.

* Theme support is great. Easy to install and easy to switch between. Having a hard time finding free, nice looking, blog oriented themes but there's no such thing as a free lunch.

* Works well with [MarsEdit][3]. My standard workflow hasn't been interrupted at all. In fact it's been supplemented since MarsEdit understands WordPress pages. Wish [Markdown][4] support wasn't a [plugin][5] but a part of the WordpPress core.

* Looking forward to using [shortcodes][6] to embed [syntax highlighted][7] code snippets.
