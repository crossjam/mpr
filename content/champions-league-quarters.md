Something's unjust in the world.  Can't say as I'm too excited about the [Blues v Benfica tie][2], but might be worth watching given what's at stake. Maybe Chelsea's vets will get up off the deck and show some pride after AVB get summarily dismissed.

Now [FC Barcelona versus AC Milan][1]? That's a battle of titans to be admired. Messi against Ibrahimovic is just the starting point. Might have to fire up the DVR for those two matches.
