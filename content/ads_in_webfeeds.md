<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> was a small company that provided proxying and analytics for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">webfeeds</a>. They became pretty popular. Then they got bought by <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Nothing changed ... for a while.

Now I'm seeing crappy image based ads in my aggregators. Yuck! Text based ads have been around for a while, but they were pretty unobtrusive. Worst of all is that the image ads are usually insanely ugly and frequently mistargeted.

This sucks!!

That is all.
