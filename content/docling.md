> Docling parses documents and exports them to the desired format with ease and speed.

GitHub [repo][3] and [technical report][2] from IBM:

> This technical report introduces Docling, an easy to use,
self-contained, MIT-licensed open-source package for PDF document
conversion. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models
for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition
(TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small
resource budget. The code interface allows for easy extensibility and
addition of new features and models.
