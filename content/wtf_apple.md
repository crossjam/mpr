The [new iPod Touch][1] is pretty nice, but why does Apple hate people who love playlists in iTunes? I have about 200+ playlists. Apparently there's no way to traverse them, other than thumb swiping through. Not fun.

But the capper is that the Touch doesn't scroll long playlist titles. Christ, my iPod Nano does that and scrolls long song titles to boot. As far as I can tell, there's no way to see a playlist title in full. I think this fundamentally stems from not being able to select an individual playlist.

WTF Apple? Makes the Touch somewhat sucky as an MP3 player. It's even worse when I know you have a working solution on a "lesser" model. Apparently a few other folks also think [this issue should be addressed][2].
