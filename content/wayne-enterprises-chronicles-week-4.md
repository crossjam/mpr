Run-DMC, Oakland’s Darren McFadden was the key blow, only scoring 4.3 fantasy points. Arian Foster had a solid 15.9 points, but that’s not enough for a RB1. So my running backs basically did me in.

Not to mention the opponent had Tom Brady storm back for 35+ points in addition to great days for Victor Cruz and Marshawn Lynch. 

The real killer is that I lost by about 22 points, but I easily had that much extra left on my bunch. As soon as [I taunt Cam Newton][1] and sit him down, he goes *(fantasy)* off against Atlanta. Stevan Ridley joined in with Brady in abusing the Bills and would have been a nice replacement for McFadden.

But that’s fantasy football for you. Still in first, barely on point differential.
