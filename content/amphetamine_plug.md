Just wanted to give a quick plug for [Amphetamine][1], a Mac OS X menu
bar app that helps control screen saving and more. On any Mac where I create a
new account, Amphetamine is in that small collection of "must
install" apps. Really well polished with a lot of functionality and
free to boot! Thanks [William Gustafson][2].
