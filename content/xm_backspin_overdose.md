Me and the missus decided to make this a road trip and see how our little guy would do on a long ride. I rented an intermediate-SUV from Avis to haul all our stuff, and as is par for modern rentals, [XM Radio][1] was installed.

The drive was about 6.5 hours road time *(7.5 wall time, with stops)* each way. Noodling around I landed on [XM's Backspin channel][2] which is wall to wall classic hip-hop. Since it was satellite, I could just park it for the entirety of the trip, commercial free.

A lot of cuts in my recently built iTunes hip-hop playlist made appearances, but there were a number of tracks I was reminded of. Gotta see if I can't purchase MP3s for:[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Request Line Label.jpg" alt="Request Line Label.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="200" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][3]

* De La Soul, *Potholes in My Lawn*

* Fat Boys, *Jailouse Rap*

* Rock Master Scott and The Dynamic Three, *Request Line*

There's plenty of other pre-1988 stuff that I'd like to be reconnected with. It's almost enough to make me seriously consider buying an XM/Sirius subscription.
