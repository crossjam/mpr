Given that I [started and abandoned][6] a transliteration of [*processing*](http://processing.org/) to Python, I'm interested in how others might approach the challenge. I just found out about the [pyprocessing][1] project. They've taken the path of using OpenGL, through [pyglet][2], which I thought about but couldn't figure out how the bit blitting capabilities of *processing* would work. That's not saying much, since I have exceedingly minimal knowledge of OpenGL.

I'll have to take *pyprocessing* out for a test drive. I hope the project succeeds. If it works well the toolkit would be a nice complement to Python's emerging heavy duty data processing capabilities: cf. [Numpy][3], [SciPy][4], and [pandas][5].
