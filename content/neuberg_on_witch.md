He's a [Witch][3] fan, so I'm in good company.  If you're a Macintosh user, you should buy a copy right this minute ;-) I've even put my own money where my mouth is and paid for a license.

At TidBITS, Neuburg outlines why [he loves the window switching application][1]. The new release improves performance and works better with Spaces. I even learned quite a bit about some advanced Witch features.

Just doin' my bit to promote the independent developer economy.

**Update:** *Corrected egregious typo of Neuburg*
