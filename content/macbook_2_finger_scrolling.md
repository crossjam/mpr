Just this past week I learned something really amazing about [my MacBook][4], even though it's clearly right there in the [machine specs][1].

My little laptop supports [two finger scrolling][2] on the trackpad.

**Woohoo!!**

While this feature is overall great for browsing the Web, it really obviates some [complaints I had about NetNewsWire][3]. Now I can easily scroll through the headlines in a folder without opening all of them. And I can easily switch between scrolling the headlines and scrolling an item body.

*Manna!!*

Yes, I am easily amused.
