I've always admired John Watson's ever growing <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/">menagerie of Flickr hacks</a>. Having recently revisited the site, I enjoyed his overview of what happens over time to <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/blog/explore-video/">one day page of Flickr's Explore</a>. A given day page is not frozen in time for Explore's purposes. The only thing that's fixed is the population that can appear on that day page: photos shot on that day. Otherwise, only the Flickr boffins know what determines which photos are displayed at any given moment.

Once upon a time I used to be really interested in Flickr's interestingness algorithm. I was also curious about the statistics and properties of the photos that did have high interestingness. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> has to be one of the nicer web service api's out there and there was a nice Python library to access the service. I implemented some code for decent sized longitudinal studies similar to Watson's captures.

Looking at the video Watson created, the thought came to me that there's actually a lot more potential for using those interesting photos as a gateway into Flickr. As his automatically built movie demonstrates, one can easily build new media artifacts with those photos as a seed. Attached to each of those photos is a Flickr user, an entry point into the Flickr social network. I'm going to start Flickr hacking again to see what I can come up with.
