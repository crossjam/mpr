I realized this weekend, that whatever success I have in fantasy football is based upon the following principle. During the currently playing weekend, I start planning for the next weekend.

By halfway through the first game on a Sunday afternoon, I'm already scanning the waiver wire for promising mid-week pickups. In leagues where you can still make afternoon free agent claims, I've jumped on key players after early injuries.

A second minor philosophy, is to consider the real world matchups, but not over think my lineup. Don't mess with players on bad teams (c.f. Indianapolis Colts 2011). Studs always play.
