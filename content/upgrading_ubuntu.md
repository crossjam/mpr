Man have they smoothed this process out!! Went from [Intrepid Ibex][2] to [Jaunty Jackalope][1] in less than a half hour, no muss no fuss. Having FiOS to make the download of 200+ MB of packages a 5 minute task also helps.

Since I'm an infrequent Linux tinkerer, this isn't a huge deal. There are a couple of major wins though. First, [Python 2.6][4] is now part of the standard distribution. This makes the most rock solid, yet latest featured, version of my favorite programming language available. I'm also guessing that a lot of Python packages are updated as well, meaning quite a few less source builds and installs by hand.

Second, [Erlang][6] and [RabbitMQ][5] have updated or new Ubuntu packages.  Experimenting with a production quality, open source, [message queuing][7] server is now a piece of cake. I sort of have a sense that with the commoditization trend of message queuing and the growth of real time notification on the Web, having working message queuing knowledge will be essential to successful programmers.
