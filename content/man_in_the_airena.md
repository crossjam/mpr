Title: Man In The AIrena

Let it be known that I made my first foray into agentic AI coding, two
days ago on July 6th, 2025. I worked with [Claude Code][3] to start
prototyping [a little tool][1] to build m3u playlists. This will come
in handy for making my local collection of music files exposable as
part of [my OwnTone project][2].

It wasn’t quite vibe coding, as I didn’t let Claude off the leash to
make changes on its own. All of its requests were reviewed
personally. At the same time, I haven’t written a line of code in the
repo. In fact, I’ve barely looked at any of the source code. Meantime,
my initial runs for building playlists look pretty good. To top it
off, now a bunch of ideas for extending the tool are cooking in my
head.

The experience hasn’t been mindblowingly life altering, but vaguely
satisfying. This is a project I would have likely procrastinated on
interminably. With an hour of effort, give or take, at least I’m
started. Lots of boilerplate and mind numbing testing avoided. So
there’s a path forward. And thoughts of many other deferred projects
that could now be within reach. Credit to Andrew Ng, [writing in The Batch][4],
for the nudge to finally push out from the dock.

I’m completely sympathetic to all the folks who are [apprehensive to
pessimistic][6] on where this is going and what it will [ultimately
cost][5]. For me, guarded experimentation is the right path forward. It
feels like there is some there there. Maybe (probably) not enough to
match the huckster BS and snake oil, but possibly [a useful normal
technology][7]. YMMV.
