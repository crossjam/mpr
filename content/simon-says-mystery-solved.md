However insulting of the viewer's intelligence it is, I still vastly enjoy most of the movie.

A thing that's been bugging me in the 11 years since the film's release is the id on one song on the soundtrack. Near the end, after Sam Rockwell's character has been revealed as the villain, he's shown in his lair grooving out to some [hard hitting' hip hop track][4]. *Damn!!*

But I never got around to seriously tracking it down. Until on a lark today, I went to IMDB, and started looking at the *Charlie's Angels* [soundtrack][3] listing. Eyeballed a couple of likely candidates by title and started googling. Took a couple of wrong turns, but finally hit on Pharoahe Monch's [*Simon Says*][1]. 

Like [Head Rush's *Underground*][5], mystery solved.
