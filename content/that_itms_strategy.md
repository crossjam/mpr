With only 35 hip-hop tracks stuffed into a looping, shuffled playlist, it seems to be working out quite well. Highlights include:

* Chemical Brothers (featuring Q-Tip), [*Galvanize*][2]. That Budweiser commercial campaign got me hooked.

* Tribe Called Quest, [*Award Tour*][3]. 1991?! Jeez I'm getting old.

* DMX, [*What's My Name*][4]. Vile lyrics, but the combined fury of DMX and the beat is an incredible combination. Makes a lightweight like me want to get up and punch someone.

* Black Eyed Peas, [*Hey, Mama*][5]. Part of the TV campaign that took the iPod to a new level of consumer consciousness.

* Souls of Mischief, [*'93 Til Infinity*][6]. Classic Bay Area flow.

* Just-Ice, [*Going Way Back*][7]. A gem known only to real hip hop hedz.

* Public Enemy, [*Fight The Power*][8]. PE and Spike Lee. Nothing else need be said.

For the past week or so, this has been the playlist for my long, commuter bus ride. iTunes is impressively good at not repeating things too closely and some of the sequences are pretty interesting. It's to the point now that I'm thinking about setting up a few more of these singles playlists. There's a bunch of 70's disco and soul, plus 80's pop that I'd be interested in collecting.

I kinda liked [Men At Work](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Men+At+Work). **Really**
