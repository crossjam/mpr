As someone who’s first good cup of copy was brewed from Peet’s beans I’m sad to see the Berkeley based roaster [absorbed into a massive corporate maw][1]. They held out much longer than I thought. Fond memories of the **eclectic** customer stream going through the tiny ur-Peet’s at Shattuck and Rose.
