Seems like there's minimal support for audio encoding, decoding, and playback.

Between NodeBox and Python, access seems tantalizingly close. NodeBox has a [Quicktime library][1], which lets you get video frames out of a QuickTime movie, but not any of the audio data. I'm now looking at Python audio modules, but there doesn't seem to be much that's mature and works on MacOS X.

We'll see though, as I've been known to be wrong.
