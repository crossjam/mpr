[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Death Race Poster.jpg" alt="Death Race Poster.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="222" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Misogynistic, homophobic, casually violent, and mostly implausible, [*Death Race*][1] is not without its charms. The attraction boils down to:

* Oddly, Jason Statham's monotone acting. Has any man gone farther playing a tough guy, a fast driver, and a tough, fast driver?

* The brutal efficiency of the plot. While requiring a lot of suspension of disbelief, there's not a lot of fat on this tale. There's really no backstory on any of the characters besides Jensen Ames. And the action doesn't stop for any crappy infodumps.

*  The incorporation of the gamer aesthetic into the cinematic experience. Not overdone as in all of the movies based upon video games, but a subtle commentary surrounding the stages of the Death Race.

* Natalie Martinez is pretty saucy.

Plus, I always find Joan Allen to be a hoot.

*Death Race* has high production values, a fast pace, good looking women, and the good guys win. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.
