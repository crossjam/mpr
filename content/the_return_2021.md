Title: Why the Return?

_Still(!!) mopping up 2021 leftovers. This one was started in
Septermber 2021. Yikes!_

So I’ve come back to blogging, maybe not at previous publishing rates,
but definitely with some consistency in late(ish) 2021. What gives?

On the day job, I got a big promotion in April (if you can navigate
LinkedIn or are decent at Google you can find the details) that’s
probably going to steer me to being much less technical at work. I’m
gonna need a hacking outlet, thus I’m aiming to do some side projects
on my off time. Previously, this blog was more life and media
commentary oriented, but I’m hoping to pivot into a better "tech"
blogger, whatever that means. At least to me it means more project
details and definitely more code.

Specifically I have five independent personal development goals I’m
currently working on

1. Mastery of the Python programming language
2. Proficiency in the Go programming language
3. Modernizing developer skills and tools
4. Developing a strong portfolio of publicly data projects
5. Creating an online technical presence

My blogging will help with number 5 but it can also be a
driver for solving some technical challenges, such as search indexing
of this blog’s content. As Simon Willison [points out][1], working in
public has a relatively low bar for online achievement that can be
extremely useful in the end.

_Fast forward, 5ish months..._

Haven’t made as much progress as I’d like on all the above, but I have
made **some** progress. My [PyBites profile][2] indicates motion in
fits and starts. Plus I’m on the cusp of another milestone, a brown
belt, just need to do a few more pesky easy bites. I’ve actually
started reading [_The Go Programming Language_][3]. Some of the gaps
in understanding from when I was just hacking away on
[nsq](https://nsq.io) are getting closed. [Discogs data][4] hacking is
happening (more to come...) and I’ve had a personal epiphany about how to go
about building data projects and a portfolio of such.

Dropping the ball on modernizing developer skills and tools, although
the PyBites work is forcing some routine git interaction. Still, me
and Emacs are joined at the hip.

Gettin’ there.
