Duly noting a number of things I’m thankful for this year:

* My enduring family, surviving and thriving as African-Americans in the US. Special remembrance for my Aunt Gracie who passed away this summer after a long battle with cancer. She went to work for NASA straight out of high school and served the country for 38 **(!!)** years. Her eulogy highlighted some of the BS she overcame but I never knew about. I’ll always remember her as a faith filled, uplifting spirit.
* Widely scattered friends, who nevertheless helped me get through a very challenging year.
* The continuing gift of my education, focused and funded by my parents, that keeps opening up opportunities of all sorts, especially chances to help others.
* Interesting, challenging, and impactful employment.
* Eight years of President Obama, an intelligent, even keeled, leader who did the office proud.
* That I actually have *a lot* to be thankful for. There are many out there struggling to find even a tiny morsel of hope.
