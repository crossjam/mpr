I've [long enjoyed][2] [Maciej Ceglowski's][3], well thought out, if rambling, [writings][4]. He's got that wry tone of Olin Shivers at his best. Recently Ceglowski unloaded [*The Social Graph is Neither*][1]. Seems to have struck a nerve in the blogosphere. Choice quote:

> *Imagine the U.S. Census as conducted by direct marketers - that's the social graph.*

Summarizations and armchair analysis don't do it justice. Check out his essay in full. Well worth the time.
