<a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2009/01/06/from-village-voice-to-blogosphere/">Scott Rosenberg beat me to it</a> but I meant to point to an interesting New Yorker article drawing <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/05/090105fa_fact_menand">parallels between The Village Voice and The Blogosphere</a>. I'm in agreement with Rosenberg that the spirit of the early Voice was akin to blogging's ethos, but that The Voice was nowhere near what the blogosphere is now. As a fan of early hip-hop, I hear echoes of the whole "Lou Reed rapped, so he was the father of hip-hop" line of argument. Yeah, right.

The correct phrasing is that The Village Voice <em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/presage">presaged</a></em> the blogosphere.
