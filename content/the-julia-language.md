As a graduate from a PLDI (Programming Language Design and Implementation) research group, I'm always suspicious when a brand spanking new language gets a lot of buzz. There are so many barriers against, nay even ways to measure, success that most of the newcomers wind up being also rans.

But the new language [julia][1] has some nice features, yet seems eminently pragmatic. Plus people who have good taste [seem enthusiastic][2] about its arrival.

Then again, [Go](http://golang.org/) was [the bee's knees][3] not too long ago and it hasn't taken over the world.
