[End of Project][1] has arrived for [UC Berkeley’s AMPLab][2]. Spark and the other varied projects of the group [hit my radar][3] back in July of 2012. The project was run according to [Prof. Dave Patterson’s guidance][4] for collaborative research centers. I think it’s fair to say AMPLab was a success.

Looking forward to [what comes next][5] and Go Bears!
