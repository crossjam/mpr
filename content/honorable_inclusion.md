[Previously][3] I had noted completing [_The Grendel Omnibus,
Volume1_][2] and [_The Infinity Gauntlet_][1] via Comixology. Normally
I don’t include graphic novels in my book reading tallys due to some
weird notion that they’re "lightweight". _Grendel_ was the equivalent
of 500 printed pages and _Infinity Gauntlet_ 250. The judges have
subsequently determined that they do qualify in this category.
