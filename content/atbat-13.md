Erica Ogg at GigaOM did [a quick review][1] of [MLB's AtBat ’13][2] mobile app:
> Opening Day of the Major League Baseball season is still about a month away. But the best app for following all the games is here already.

I agree and have already anted up my for my season pass. It was well worth it last year. By far the best and most useful of the professional sports apps.
