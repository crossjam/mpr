Speaking of Princeton, I’m intrigued by the [Cornell-Princeton Center for Network Programming][1]

> The Center for Network Programming supports research on languages, algorithms, and tools for network programming, and facilitates closer interactions with partners in industry and government. 

As a bona fide, card carrying, UC Berkeley computer systems junkie, this warms the cockles of my heart. Especially projects like [frenetic][3]. In particular, I sense that the new era of [*software defined networking (SDN)*][2] and network programming languages is a phase change. I may just be an old PLDI nerd but this feels like a big deal. At least it will be a lot of fun!
