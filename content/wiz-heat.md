Somehow I lucked out and had a ticket for the second Washington Wizards victory of the season. Against reigning NBA champs, the Miami Heat, no less. 

Have to say I was fairly subdued until the final minute, when I realized the Wiz could actually win. Otherwise, I was anticipating collapse, but the Heat never really turned on the defense.
