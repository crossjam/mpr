[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Sprint HTC Evo.jpg" alt="Sprint HTC Evo.jpg" border="0" width="100" height="140" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][3] As there's wider penetration of [the HTC Evo][3] to reviewers, more reports of the smartphone are coming in.

+1. Ginny Mies has a fairly [positive review of the phone][1] over at Macworld.

-1. MG Siegler of [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com), admittedly a fan of the iPhone, is [down on the Evo][2]. The big minus for him is the battery life, but also the difference in the UI fit and finish relative to the iPhone.

Nothing in his review really surprises me or is a showstopper. I aslo think you need more than a week or two to truly appreciate the qualities of any phone, but that goes for all the reviews I've seen so far.

The Evo is still my next phone frontrunner. However, I'll be interested to see what comes out of Apple in June. And I'll check out the Evo in the store just to get a good sense of its physical presence.
