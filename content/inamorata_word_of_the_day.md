Ran across this word while reading David Denby's [excellent review of Clint Eastwood's career][3]. Was instantly struck by a certain elegance and the clear Latin root.

[inamorata][2], [via Wiktionary][2]

1. *n.*, \in-am-uh-RAH-tuh\, a female lover or love interest

Seems like a word apropos of [Elle Driver's][4] fetish for gargantuan.

*I've always liked that word... "inamorata"... so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.*
