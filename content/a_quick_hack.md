Above is the result of taking 30 minutes to transliterate Tarbell's [*sand.stroke*][1] sketch into peyote. Admittedly, it's basically a subset of [*substrate*][2], so there's a lot of similar code. However, I think it's cool peyote is decent enough to whip stuff out quickly.

I've been trawling [processing.org](http://processing.org) and [openprocessing.org](http://openprocessing.org) for interesting sketches. I've discovered that I'll need some [Perlin noise][3] generation in the toolbox.
