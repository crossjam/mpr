Link parkin': [*Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade*][1]. Comes [highly recommended][2]. Warning though, the material is a 50 minute, 1 GB  QuickTime file, password protected by an ACM account. You can Flash stream it as well.

Seems like real-time at global scale is the new frontier.
