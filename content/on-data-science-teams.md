I'm anointing myself as a *“Mad Data Scientist, Apprentice 3rd Class, Autodidact”* based upon hacking activities at work and at home. One of the things that's starting to interest me is constructing teams of people to do investigations into massive data sets. Herewith a couple of interesting links related to the topic:

Kurt Schrader, [*Building a Data Science Team at a Startup - An Engineering Perspective*][1]

> *“A data science team seems to end up having people from a much more diverse set of backgrounds than a normal engineering team does, and because of that you're going to need to figure out how to fit the data science team into your organization. One thing that we've eventually come around to is to throw our normal engineering practices out of the window and to start working towards having the data science team work with whatever tools they need in order to move as quickly as possible in their own way.”*

DJ Patil, [*Building Data Science Teams*][2]

> *“All the top data scientists share an innate sense of curiosity. Their curiosity is broad, and extends well beyond their day-to-day activities. They are interested in understanding many different areas of the company, business, industry, and technology. As a result, they are often able to bring disparate areas together in a novel way. For example, I've seen data scientists look at sales processes and realize that by using data in new ways they can make the sales team far more efficient. I've seen data scientists apply novel DNA sequencing techniques to find patterns of fraud.”*
