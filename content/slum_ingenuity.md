Being a fan of cities, I was drawn to Stewart Brand's contention that [the ingenuity of urban slums][1] provide examples of how to make metropolises more green.

<blockquote><em>

The point is clear: environmentalists have yet to seize the opportunity offered by urbanisation. Two major campaigns should be mounted: one to protect the newly-emptied countryside, the other to green the hell out of the growing cities.

</em></blockquote>

You have to parse his argument carefully though. It's not a call to perpetuate slums, and Brand probably underplays the intense misery and injustice that engenders slum "innovation". The commenters *(and do read the comments)* perform quite well in pointing this out. Brand may also oversell the positives of modern urbanism.

Still, a thought provoking take.
