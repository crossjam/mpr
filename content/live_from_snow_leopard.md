My copy of Snow Leopard arrived yesterday. I took a couple of hours this evening to backup my drive and then set about to upgrading. Took all of 1 unattended hour. Everything seems kosher.

I used the backup time to read [John Siracusa's Ars Technica review of Snow Leopard][1]. Talk about in depth! 23 web pages covering every micro-detail of Apple's operating system, update, upgrade, service pack, whatever you want to call it.

+1 for the integration of the [Dock and Expose][2]. Makes minimized windows more useful.

-1 for 64 bit [Safari, with no plug-in capability][3]. The supremely useful [Saft][4] is now in limbo.
