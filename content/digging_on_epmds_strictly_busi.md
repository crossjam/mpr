I'm really starting to think so. The bass/piano combo on the fours hammers the underlying beat. Plus it's one of their finest lyrical efforts.

Exhibit A

<em>

Try to answer to the master on the mc rap artists<br/>

No joke on the lyric -it's hard to be modest<br/>

I knew i was the man with the master plan<br/>

To make you wiggle and jiggle like gelatin<br/>

</em>

Exhibit B

<em>

Total chaos -- no mass confusion <br/>

Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion <br/>

Like a magician who draws a rabbit out a hat son <br/>

I'm drawin' more, like a 44-magnum <br/>

</em>

Exhibit C

<em>

You're just a soldier . . . and I'm a green beret <br/>

I do not think twice about the mcs I slay <br/>

So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this: <br/>

Bring your dog, mom, and dad . . . because i'm strictly business <br/>

</em>

A pretty good case could be made.
