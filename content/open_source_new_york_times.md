Recently The New York Times has been making quite a push to [open up](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com) some of its internal software development to the rest of the world.

* [A large, labeled data corpus of articles](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/fatten-up-your-corpus/) is available

* They've recently exposed [an article search API](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/announcing-the-article-search-api/)

* IBM's technology behind [Many Eyes](http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/) is now being used for [a white label social visualization silo](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/the-new-york-times-data-visualization-lab/) within The Times' site.

Obviously as one of the worlds legendary newspapers, The Times developers have unique repositories of content to work with. Counter that with a business that seems to be springing leaks in its revenue streams left and right. Careful observers will note that commercial usage is typically prohibited, so don't plan on making a bundle off of their content. In any event, it's admirable that such a significant media concern is making so much available for people to experiment with.

One thing they could be doing on the [blog](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/) though, is promoting external projects that leverage Times open source code and web APIs. If they had an evangelist, probably can't afford one, I wonder what they would do.

*Now if we could only get The New Yorker to venture out in a similar way!*
