Well for once, I do actually seem to be maintaining [a book reading habit][1]. <del datetime="2018-07-02T01:14:32+00:00">Three</del> Four more completed to add to the list:

1. [*“The Last Good Man,”*][3] Linda Nagata
2. [*“The Lean Startup,”*][2] Eric Ries
3. [*“The Peripheral,”*][4] William Gibson
4. [*“Lexicon,”*][6] Max Barry

A recurring theme in my reading of William Gibson novels is their improvement upon reread. I didn’t really cotton to *“Zero History”* until after a few visits. As in that case, [the initial review was muddled][5]. This time around, the subtle breakneck pace of the narrative (events only occurred over the better part of a week) and the general inhumane nature of The Jackpot and The Klept were more resonant. *“The Peripheral”* also got a new sheen in light of political events in the US that happened after its publication.

*“The Lean Startup”* has achieved a bit of a cult like status, but it feels like a useful framework for guiding a startup. A qualifier on this statement since I’ve only notionally been involved with startups and never really in the breach. The innovation accounting methods didn’t feel all that actionable though.

I sort of [bought *“The Last Good Man”* on a whim][7]. It was a solid purchase and an enjoyable read. Four or five different narrative perspectives popped up, which was probably two to three to many for me and there were a lot of named characters to track. The background theme of autonomized (*sp*) warfare was compelling. Loved the character of True Brighton.

A friend sent me a copy of *“Lexicon”* a while ago, I gave it a start, didn’t catch fire, and then got sucked into it on a cross-country flight. The book lives up to [its reviews][9] and caught me by surprise. My only knock is a villain that’s a bit too close to infallible, but otherwise just a great fantastical thriller spiced with interesting social commentary. And a great love story to boot.
