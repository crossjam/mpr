In [his description][1] of his approach, looks like the final output will be in a bloggish format. My guess is that the results will feel closer to a liveblog than a polished newspaper article. ReadWriteWeb has [a deeper conversation][3] with Allen about what he's attempting.

There's also a similar project, called [SportsMonkey][4], from some of my former colleagues at Northwestern University. From the ReadWriteWeb article you can get a sense of what SportsMonkey provides, and a floor for what StatSheet should be able to achieve.

It'll be interesting to see if either approach gains traction. And as always with the news/publishing in these times, the key question is where the revenue comes from. Even if it's automated, still gotta feed the servers.
