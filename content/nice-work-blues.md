When you give up a goal in the first minute, and are down two at the end of the first half, you're not really championship material.

Meanwhile, ManU only has to claim a point against either of the two bottom feeders, Blackburn or Blackpool, to clinch the title.

What a waste of DVR space. At least there's still the Champions League final: [FC Barcelona vs Manchester United][2] at Wembley. Can't wait.
