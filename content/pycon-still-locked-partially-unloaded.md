An exceedingly high profile work event has popped up. Luckily it's located in Menlo Park, CA but of course it's scheduled for March 7th and 8th. That's right, dead on top of [the 4 tutorials I planned to attend][2] at PyCon 2012.

The downside is that I can't mainline my PyCon experience like I wanted to. And I was really looking forward to catching up with Allen Downey, a contemporary of mine at UC Berkeley.

The upside is that my flight should now be reimbursed, I get a couple of nights in a hotel, and I can probably expense a rental car. Plus two vacation days I was planning to take go back in the bank. Yeah me!

Maybe I'll make up for it at [SciPy 2012][3]. There's some fine folks I'd like to visit in Austin, TX.

Kudos to the PyCon arrangements team though. I was refunded my tutorial payments with no hassle and the reversal cleared my credit card a day or two ago.
