Just had to acknowledge Simon Willison’s [20th anniversary of
blogging][1]. I have a very loose tie in that I used to have an
appointment at the [Medill School of Journalism][7]. At the time, the
concept of Content Management Systems wasn’t ingrained in media
circles. Working with a colleague, we introduced a rudimentary
platform that was used as part of every MS student’s stint in
[Medill’s downtown Chicago newsroom][3].

So of course when I first heard of [Django][5] and [how it was born in
a newsroom][6], I had to have Adrian Holovaty come up to Evanston and
give a talk. For a while, Adrian and I lived relatively close by in
Chicago and would bump into each other at [ChiPy][4] meetups. Thus the
extremely loose tie to Simon.

I really enjoy and admire Simon’s current stream of work, especially
on [Datasette][2]. Despite the volume, his blog is one of a handful
that I look forward to with anticipation for new content. That guy can
crank out some code, but also has good taste in problems, and will go
down a few layers into the technology. Here’s to many more posts to
come!
