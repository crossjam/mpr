As Simon Willison points out ["Vibe coding is having a
moment."][1]. Here’s a couple of related random thoughts. Just
thinking out loud.

Does it make any sense for an open source project to craft issues that
are highly amenable to vibe solutions? These could be a
means of addressing low stakes work. Alternatively, a really gentle on
ramp for new contributors.

Coding for generative art is a really low stakes form of
development. Wonder how well vibe coding works for an environment like
[processing][2], [Cinder][3], or [openFrameworks][4].
