My [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) T-Shirt arrived in the mail on Monday. Although I'm not sanguine about [American Apparel's](http://americanapparel.net) advertising, DF's provider did produce one of the nicest $30 T-shirts I've bought recently (or ever).

Clearly this is the beginning of a slow descent into Macintosh fanboyism. I'm happy to support [John Gruber's](http://daringfireball.net/colophon/) work though.
