This [overview deck][3] provides a lot more detail.


Didn’t realize that the [Linux Foundation][4] had an Artificial
Intelligence and Data thrust, with a bushel of [projects][1] under its
umbrella. A few of them are having a pretty big industry impact.

Discovered this via poking around at the [Milvus][5] repository:


> Milvus is an open-source vector database built to power embedding
> similarity search and AI applications. Milvus makes unstructured
> data search more accessible, and provides a consistent user
> experience regardless of the deployment environment.

> Milvus 2.0 is a cloud-native vector database with storage and
> computation separated by design. All components in this refactored
> version of Milvus are stateless to enhance elasticity and
> flexibility. For more architecture details, see Milvus Architecture
> Overview.
