In my past life, I was interested in conducting research on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregator">RSS Aggregators</a>, so I'm a bit of an afficianado. On <a href="http://crossjam.net/mpr/2008/08/happiness-is-a.html">the new Macbook</a>, I use <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a>, but I'm a really big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a>.

I use Google Reader a lot, even to the point of hacking around with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyrfeed/wiki/GoogleReaderAPI">the unofficial API</a>. I'm always thinking of ways to turn the application into a high powered information trapping tool.

Both GReader and GMail have the ability to star information. GMail one ups Reader though with the experimental <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/gmail-superstars.html">Superstars</a> feature. Superstars is basically a hyperfast way to tag items. Adding this to Reader, and then being able to see the results through the API, would be a great addition.
