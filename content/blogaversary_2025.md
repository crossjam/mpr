What a momentous day!! According to my math, this blog is heading into
its 17th year of existence. It all [started][1] way back when with a
white plastic MacBook. That thing is still kicking as well 😲. An
Intel Mac, I’ve had it happily running Ubuntu Linux for a few
years. Despite only having 2 CPU cores and 4GB of RAM it still comes
in handy for varied experiments.

But a downer as well. Today I got laid off from my current gig. I had
a pretty good streak of picking my exits, but this came out of the
blue. Won’t define me though. Just more time to really figure out
what’s real and what’s BS in the agentic tool space.

Onwards to new adventures 🏴‍☠️ & 🥷!
