> We introduce NuExtract 1.5, the new version of our foundation model
> for structured extraction. NuExtract 1.5 is multilingual, can handle
> arbitrarily long documents, and outperforms GPT-4o in English while
> being 500 times smaller. As usual, we release it under MIT license.

> Before diving into the details of what's new, let's discuss what
> this is all about. NuExtract is a family of small open-source models
> that do only one thing: they extract information from documents and
> return a structured output (JSON). It turns out that, because they
> only do this one thing, they are very good at it.
