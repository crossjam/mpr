A series on [data analysis, from R to Python][1], definitely worth tracking:

> Will it Python? posts are my attempts to port data analyses originally done in R into Python.

> The objective isn’t to just make a key that translates functions and methods in R into Python equivalents. Instead, the goal is to reproduce the results and insights of the analysis in idiomatic Python (to the extent I’m qualified to judge such a thing). Sometimes there will be a direct translation from a line of R to a line of Python; other times Python will suggest an altogether different approach to the problem.
