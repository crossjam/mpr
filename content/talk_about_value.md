* *Gods of the North (a.k.a. The Frost Giant's Daughter)*

* *Queen of the Black Coast*

* *Shadows in the Moonlight*

* *A Witch Shall be Born*

* *Shadows in Zamboula*

* *The Devil in Iron*

* *The People of the Black Circle*

* *The Pool of the Black One*

* *Red Nails*

* *Jewels of Gwahlur*

* *Beyond the Black River*

* *The Hour of the Dragon*

* *The Hyborian Age*

These are all top of the line Robert E. Howard originals, no L. Sprague De Camp to be found. I'm particularly excited to have some version of *Beyond the Black River*, one of the best Conan stories ever.

Oh and all this for only 99 cents.
