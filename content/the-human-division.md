Loved John Scalzi’s *Old Man’s War* trilogy so his upcoming project, [*The Human Division*][1] looks intriguing: 
> My next project from Tor is called *The Human Division*. It takes place in the “Old Man’s War” universe, after the events of *The Last Colony* and *Zoe’s Tale*. It is not, strictly speaking, a novel.
