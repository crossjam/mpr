[Ned Batchelder][2] is a wise elder of the Python community. He recently
offered [this advice][1] on side projects, _"Forgive yourself"_

As someone who’s using side projects as "auditionware", I need to keep
this philosophy in mind.

Batchelder also plenty of other good bits of advice in that
post. Especially the nugget about how "nice" becomes easier the more
you do it. Gotta get the reps. 

Meanwhile, just go read the whole thing.
