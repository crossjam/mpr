I recently worked on a proposal that heavily incorporated the notion of [*unikernels*][2]. Even still, I’m not really sure I could have explained what they were to even someone else technically proficient.

Enter the [Google Cloud Platform Podcast][3]. Listening to [Pivotal’s John Feminella][1] I finally heard a clear, clean explanation. Check it out for yourself, but the notion of an automatically constructed, application specific, machine image that can run on a hypervisor nails it for me.

They’re still **extremely** bleeding edge, but it looks like [unikernel][4] based approaches will have a place in the microservices oriented future.

**P.S.** I just started listening to the GCP Podcast, but I’m encouraged by how informative these first couple of episodes have been.
