E-mailing links essentially means sending mail from myself to myself. GMail happily receives such e-mails but doesn't run filters on them, foiling my carefully crafted instant labeling/filing scheme.

Since GMail supports IMAP, I thought I'd give programming a workaround a shot. Adding my own messages to IMAP folders turned out to be easier than I thought, thanks to Python. Pulling info out of apps through AppleScript/[Python appscript][2] is more painful than I anticipated. Still I've managed to get notetaking from within Safari down to making a selection and hitting a keystroke. That's with a little help from [Red Sweater's FastScripts][3].

I think I'll be anteing up for FastScripts soon. Scripting the Mac with Python is F-U-N!

And should be a short step to getting something working for NetNewsWire, where I do my heaviest feed reading on the Mac.
