Drives me batty.

Jeff van Gundy, in today’s Heat-Knicks broadcast, let fly with “LeBron James is one of the 10 best NBA players ever.” Oh really Jeff? Here’s ten names of NBA greats, in no particular order:

* Bill Russell
* Wilt Chamberlain
* Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* Shaquille O’Neal
* Michael Jordan
* Larry Bird
* Magic Johnson
* Jerry West
* Oscar Robertson
* Kobe Bryant
* *Honorable mention to: Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Isaiah Thomas, Elgin Baylor, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, and Pete Maravich*

I love James’ physical gifts and talents, but right now, which one of those names are you replacing with LeBron James?

Oh, and could some destitute NBA team hire van Gundy so I don’t have to listen to him on the TV anymore?
