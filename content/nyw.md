Title: NYW: Narrate Your Work
Author: C. Ross Jam

Not sure why it just suddenly hit me in the face since I’ve been
tracking the blogosphere for decades now, but the writers I enjoy the
most constantly write about things they’re actually working on:

* Dave Winer is the godfather here
* Simon Willison is top of my charts at the moment
* Love Julia Evans so much, I’ve bought all the zines
* Tim Bray has been excellent forever
* Rui Carmo is great, although not directly in my wheelhouse
* Slight zag, but Steven Berlin Johnson is also good at this at the
  intersection of writing and technology
* Armin Ronacher comes and goes, but when he’s on, he’s on
* Shout out Matt Webb, even if product design isn’t my bag
* Vicki Boykis infrequent pieces have been really good
* And Eugene Yan deep dives on AI stuff like nobody’s business
* Jon Udell also helped set the standard, although The New Stack venue
  doesn’t  really work for me.

I’m much more, partial to the long form style in blogs as opposed to the
ephemeral flow from The Socials (TM). YMMV.

__Narrate Your Work__ is what I’m aspiring to in the remainder of
the year.
