Still working to schedule my three large scale tech events this year. PyCon is close to set, but now I need conferences two and three.

Don't know how I missed this, but O'Reilly and Cloudera [combined Hadoop World and Strata][2]. It's going to be in New York, in October. Perfect topic, timing, and location. We'll have to see what the registration costs are and of course New York isn't exactly the cheapest city to visit.

Meanwhile, [SciPy 2012][1] will be in July in Austin. Downsides? Another Python conference and Texas in July. Upsides? Another Python conference and it's Austin, Texas. With friends in the area, it's very tempting.

And I'd still like to squeeze in a [David Beazley Chicago Python course][3].
