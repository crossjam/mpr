[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Safari Logo.jpg" alt="Safari Logo.jpg" border="0" width="113" height="128" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Late last year I [rejoined my long time browsing love][2], Firefox. It's been a good run, but there's a big issue with Firefox on the Macintosh. Scriptability. Being able to drive applications with AppleScript, and consequently other languages like Python, is a big distinguisher on the Mac. Despite the quirks, scripting works way better than on Windows, and can be a real boon to productivity. I've been looking at application scripting as a means to make my [information trapping][4] as frictionless as possible.

Looks like the upcoming version of [Firefox will still suck at scripting][3].

So now I'm going to take [Safari][1] out for an extended spin. Looking at my Firefox usage, the only significant missing feature was extensions. Only two were important: [TabMixPlus][5] (mainly for session saving), and [ColorfulTabs][6]. I can live without the latter and it seems like there are Safari extensions to deal with the former.

We'll see how it goes. There have been a couple of minor muscle memory issues so far, but things look promising.
