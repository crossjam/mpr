I forked [sonos-lastfm][1] just to noodle around with Sonos monitoring
generally. Dubbed the project [soco-scribbler][2] as it’ll scribble
down locally what’s been played for later usage. Goal one is to record
plays to [sqlite][3] via [sqlite-utils][4]. Then onwards to
reconciliation with [last.fm](http://last.fm) assuming there’s a
parallel scrobbler going, like the hit or miss Sonos
plugin. Afterwards, who knows.


Forza.
