TIL [jsonpath-ng][1]

> A final implementation of JSONPath for Python that aims to be
> standard compliant, including arithmetic and binary comparison
> operators, as defined in the original JSONPath proposal. ... 

> This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it
> is a full language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions
> are first class objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print,
> and extend. 

And a nice, [quick tutorial][2] to go with it.
