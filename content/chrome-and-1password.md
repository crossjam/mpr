[Disabling Flash][3] has clearly improved things, but I'm still noticing bouts of poor machine behavior. In some way, shape, or form the 1Password Chrome extension is part of the problem. Often times when I go to it to fill in a password it'll take minutes *(yes minutes)* to pop up the selection dialog. And the Chrome Task Manager shows the 1Password extension process taking up a couple hundred MBs of memory. 

Note that [other folks are having similar issues][1]. At least AgileBits is aware of the issue. But if this keeps up I'll have to push all of my 1Password usage to Firefox. Not horrible, but a bit of a pain.
