Wow! Basho’s [Ricon East][2] conference was a little more diverse and wide ranging than I anticipated. 
This was evidenced  by [Anders Pearson’s summary of the talks][1] he attended. For example, this lede on *ZooKeeper for the Skeptical Architect by Camille Fournier, VP of Technical Architecture, Rent the Runway*:
> Camille presented ZooKeeper from the perspective of an architect who is a ZooKeeper committer, has done large deployments of it at her previous employer (Goldman Sachs), left to start her own company, and that company doesn't use ZooKeeper. In other words, taking a very balanced engineering view of what ZooKeeper is appropriate for and where you might not want to use it.

Of the talks Pearson summarized, only two were by Bash employees while the rest were by some pretty serious distributed folks such as Margo Seltzer and Theo Schlossnagle. Plus there was a healthy dose of industry war story experience at scale.

Good on Basho!
