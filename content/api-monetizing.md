Jacob Perkins describes [turning a side hacking project into something “profitable”][1]: 
> Mashape was just what I needed to monetize the text-processing API, and it's improved tremendously since I started using it. They handle all the necessary details, plus a lot more, like usage charts, latency & uptime measurements, and automatic client library generation. This last is one of my favorite features, because the client libraries are generated using your API documentation, which provides a great incentive to accurately document the ins & outs of your API. Once you've documented your API, downloadable libraries in 5 different programming languages are immediately available, making it that much easier for new users to consume your API. As of this writing, those languages are Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Objective C.
