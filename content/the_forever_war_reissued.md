This is great, I've been looking to read [*The Forever War*](http://www.amazon.com/Forever-War-Joe-Haldeman/dp/0312536631) for a while. For whatever reason, Amazon only had old copies at outrageous prices through 3rd party sellers. My local library didn't even have a copy.

Now I can get my hands on a must read classic. We'll see how well time has treated it.
