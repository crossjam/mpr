As someone who has adorned his MacBook with a number of stickers, and a long time fan of the [free software][2] movement, I wholly endorse the open source sticker campaign. [openstickers.com][1] is a free as in beer and free as in freedom collection of images that you can print on adhesive paper, cut out, and stick wherever you like.

Now where do I get adhesive photographic paper?
