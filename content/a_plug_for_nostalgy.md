The recent [upgrade  of Thunderbird][2] busted my installation of [Nostalgy][1]. Thankfully the developer release is compatible with the latest version of Thunderbird. This just served to remind me of the amazing utility of keyboard based functionality. Nostalgy enables the ability to copy or move e-mails to folders based upon keystrokes. Between improved search in Thunderbird and Nostalgy, I can power through filing hundreds of e-mails in a short period of time.

Nostalgy is one of two Thunderbird add-ons I have installed. The other is [Correct Identity][3] for selecting accounts on outgoing e-mail. I could probably get by without Correct Identity, but I might have to shoot myself if Nostalgy every bites the dust. Heartily recommended.
