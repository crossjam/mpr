Especially late in the season when matchups that looked exciting in July fizzled because one or both teams had disintegrated. This eventually led to the flex system which allowed the networks to schedule more attractive late season games into the primetime slots.

I don't know what deal the league made with the devil for the 2011 season, but the night games for the season opening were amazing. To wit:

* The last two Super Bowl champs, Green Bay and New Orleans, go toe-to-toe in a last play, goal line stand thriller. Rodgers and Brees come out firing on all cylinders. Plus there was a 108 yard kickoff return for a TD. That's your season opener.

* The Sunday night game showcases America's Team, Dallas, versus the New York Jets. In New York. On the tenth anniversary of 9/11. Hometeam goes on a dramatic 17 point 4th quarter scoring spree to pull out the comeback victory. Said spree includes a blocked punt for a TD

* ESPN has a double header on Monday night, with a decidedly lukewarm tilt between New England and Miami to start off. Miami hangs in for about 3 quarters. The Fish were especially helped by a pick-6 off of Tom Brady, his first interception in 350+ attempts. Then the Pats explode to put Miami down, but along the way Wes Welker goes for a 99 yard TD reception and Brady totals 517 yards in the air.

* The second ESPN game is the Raiders vs Denver, two mediocre teams that hate each other. Per usual there's a scrum after just about every play. While outplaying the Broncos, the Raiders can't pull away. A 90 yard punt return sparks the Broncos in the second half, but the Raiders manage to hold on for the win. Did I mention that Sebastian Janikowski kicked a league record tying 63 yard field goal?

No real duds, lots of riveting action, and even some historical performances. Way to kick off the season NFL.
