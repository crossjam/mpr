But things might be coming together.

[Reported][3] as coming directly from Joe Haldeman himself, Scott teamed up with a script writer he has worked with before, [David Peoples][6]. Peoples wrote the screenplay for *Unforgiven* and *Twelve Monkeys*. Oh and that iconic *Blade Runner* flick.

[Upon further review][5] though, Peoples has moved on from the writing project. The screenplay is now in the hands of [Matthew Michael Carnahan][7]. Nothing particularly outstanding on his short resume, but no particular dogs either.

The movie could still end up in development hell, but these bits of news make me a little less skeptical.
