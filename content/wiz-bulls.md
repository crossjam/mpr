Surprising to me the Wiz pulled away in the third quarter, stifling the Bulls offense for over eight minutes. They coasted the rest of the way, shutting down a few feeble surges. It should be noted that the Bulls were playing without Luol Deng.

Still need a larger sample size, but the Wiz have at least moved from under the barrel to the bottom of the barrel. And that’s within shouting distance of the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. Who’d a thunk?!
