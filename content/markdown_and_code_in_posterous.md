First off, you can style posts with [Markdown][2]. This is convenient for me, since I use Markdown in [MarsEdit][3] to author my posts for [MPR](http://crossjam.net/mpr/). One post format across multiple tools is handy.

Posterous also added code syntax highlighting. Basically you can markup sections of a post that have code from a wide variety of programming languages. Then the code text will be rendered in a much friendlier fashion for presenting and copy/pasting program snippets. I've thought of posting code here on occasion, but didn't want to hassle with getting it formatted correctly. This Posterous feature gives me a place to park those posts.

We'll ignore the fact that I haven't really been posting to my [Posterous blog][4] much lately. Maybe these new features will help get me going again.
