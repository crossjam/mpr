On second thought, I'm probably better off using [IMAP][1] for that [synch up of my notes folder and GReader][2]. If you use SMTP, you need a mail relay. I pay [Mailhop][3] $20/*year* for 200 outbound e-mails/*day*. Still, when developing and debugging it'd probably be easy to screw things up, chew through that quota, and end up looking like a spammer.

Better to come off looking like a busted e-mail client than looking like a spammer.
