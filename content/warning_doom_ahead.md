All across the land, fantasy football league drafts are taking place.

I know [you don't care about my fantasy team][1]. I wanted to alert the audience to the fact that I will be guiding a new edition of Doom Patrol in defense of [my office league title][2]. I was getting a little nervous there, but the commish finally pulled the trigger on the league invites. Unfortunately it's short suspense, as our draft is this Friday evening.

There will be chronicling.

You have been warned.
