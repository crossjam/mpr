<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://crossjam.net/wp/mpr/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/iTermScreenSnapz004.png" alt="ITermScreenSnapz004" border="0" width="484" height="208" style="margin: 10px;"/></div>In the past few days I’ve:

1. [Transitioned my feedreading][3] experience post-GReader
2. Upgraded my WordPress installation and a couple of plug-ins
3. Gone from Ubuntu 11.10 *(pictured above, 591 days uptime wow!)* to Ubuntu 12.10

Everything so far has been pretty painless, other than [one lingering bug in feedbin][1] that only seems to affect the feed for [Tim Bray's Ongoing][2]. Unfortunately, this is one of my favorite feeds. Seems a bit suspect that the issue lingers as Bray and his feed have been around for like ever, and a good feed library should process his, of all people’s, correctly. But I’ll chalk it up to feedbin’s growing pains.

And ReadKit is passable, but I wouldn’t exactly call it … zippy … on Ye Olde MacBook.
