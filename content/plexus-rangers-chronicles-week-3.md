The Rangers got beat by a little under 48 points. I was saved from the worst beating award by someone who got shellacked for a 60 point loss.

This is the third week in a row I've had a player incur an injury that put them out the next week. I lucked out in that Steven Jackson and Miles Austin had decent and great games. Kenny Britt wasn't so lucky, done for the season with no production.

I'm patting myself on the back for picking up Buffalo's Fred Jackson off the waiver wire. Only he and Aaron Rodgers scored in double digits for me. Meanwhile the opposing team had five 15+ point scorers, including Jermichael Finley going for 30. Note that it's pretty difficult in fantasy football to gain ground when your quarterback is throwing TDs to the other guy's tight end.

Biggest disappointment was Rashard Mendenhall, who couldn't do anything against the Colts. The Pittsburgh running game is giving me the willies.

Anyhew, back to the waiver wire. Gotta scrounge another receiver.
