My team did it despite a craptaculous performance from my wide receivers. Eric Decker and Miles Austin combined for a whopping 6.7 points. 

Thankfully, Tony Gonzalez *(Go Bears!!)* was in my starting lineup for approximately 30 fantasy points. Running backs Arian Foster and Stevan Ridley showed up as well. Basically half of my team carried the load.

Frankly though, it’s pretty sad when you’re sweating it out on Monday night, hoping the kicker does just enough to keep the spread. Especially since my opponent had the Pittsburgh defense against Kansas City, a situation ripe for defensive scores.

A comfortable 17 point win all told and the league’s second position firmly in hand with four games to go.
