I’m starting to keep an eye out for good GReader diaspora stories. [Evan Dashevsky spent a week with Feedly][1]:
> To that end, I decided to try my luck with Feedly, a service that has quickly grown to prominence as the go-to replacement for Reader. After a week of test-driving the service in its Web and app versions, I have found it to be a serviceable—and in many ways, superior—replacement for my soon-to-expire Reader.

The one thing I’m looking for is the cross-client synching capabilities.
