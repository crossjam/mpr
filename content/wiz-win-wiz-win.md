The Wiz were the last NBA team to get a win this season, and ended an eight game losing streak.

[As bad as the Wizards are][1], I'm perversely jazzed at potentially getting in on the **ground** floor of something that will eventually be on the way up. This may arguably be the worst pro team I've ever tracked in my 30+ years of following the NBA. Even worse than the 1998 post-Jordan Chicago Bulls. Give Washington a few more lottery picks, dump the riff raff, and playoffs “here we come again”. The Wiz are my little side fling, to complement my mainstay this year the 2012 now-Derrick Rose Bulls.

The Tebowcracy, however, continues.
