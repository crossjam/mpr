Title: Newsletter Knowledge

[Speaking][1] of newsletters, a while ago I was trying to recover a
web page on password handling in Python ([_Secure Password Handling in
Python_][2]) that I had just left in a browser tab. I’ve got a bunch of
Chrome profiles, always have multiple Chrome/Firefox/Safari windows
open, each with multiple (**multiple**) tabs open. Due to a couple of
reboots and default age limits on browser history it was looking grim
on finding that link again. While useful, the page wasn’t search
engine optimized enough to come in at the top of Google with the
obvious keywords.

Bother.

Then I remembered which Chrome profile likely had the tab. Popped over
to the window and pulled up GMail for that account. Hit the GMail
search bar with "credentials" and there it is, right in the [PyCoder’s
Weekly][3] newsletter.

All to say, over time a collection of link newsletters actually
represents a significant knowledge base of curated references. The
links have been vetted by humans for collection. For many of them,
there’s an authored text summary nearby. There’s a timestamp attached,
along with other metadata.

What if you grabbed those newsletters out of mailboxes and shoved them
into a text and/or semantic search engine? Possibly another component
of a personal memex.
