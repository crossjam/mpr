After my spoiler adventures with the UEFA Champions League, I learned my lesson and avoided sports and news outlets on my way home from work. Worked like a charm as my DVR recording of The Manchester Derby went off without a hitch. 

I knew it was a big match but I was somewhat surprised at the level of hyperbole even for ESPN announcers. “The biggest match in the 20 year history of the Premiership!” Okay. If you say so.

It wasn’t an epic match in terms of play, thanks mostly to Sir Alex Ferguson going all conservative and playing guys like Scholes, Giggs, and Park *??!?* How Valencia gets all of 15 minutes and Chicharito doesn’t see the field is beyond me. But the strategy did stifle the Man City creativity, and if it wasn’t for the Kompany header, the Red Devils might be on their way to yet another title.

Since I’m a bit of a Man U hater, I quite enjoyed the Citizens going to the top of the table with their 1-0 victory. Let’s see if they can hang on through these last two games.
