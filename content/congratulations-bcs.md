You've successfully managed to make me not care about the NCAA College Football post-season. To be honest I was way more excited about the regular season Alabama-LSU matchup then the BCS Championship Game. The former was appointment TV. The latter was something I got around to after reading to My Little Guy (TM), putting him to bed, and getting a bite to eat. Missed one field goal. Oh well, there were plenty more to go around.

Might be time to put old Brent Musberger out to pasture. Between *Honey Badger!* utterances and mocking the LSU offense getting across the fifty yard line, I was close to done.

As to any other bowl fare, I mostly snoozed my way through Cal’s defeat in the Holiday Bowl. When I was awake, there was a lot of Angry Birds Rio playing. The Rose Bowl got cursory coverage as I was out at a Chicago bar visiting a friend. Sound down and reminiscing about the old neighborhood.

At this point, I’m not even sure a playoff could bring back my enthusiasm. That’s how jaded I am about college sports. Oh well, there’s always The Big Game.

And apparently quite a few other folks are [voting with their clickers][1]. Take that Self-Proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports™!

*[Big Game in October 2012?!][2] WTF!*
