Link parkin’: a Pelican plugin that [enables YAML formatted front matter][1]

> This Pelican plugin allows articles written in Markdown to define

> It is fully backwards-compatible with the default metadata parsing.

I’m also working up another blog that uses [quarto][3]. Quarto
Markdown is Pandoc Markdown which is [extended to use YAML for its
metadata][2]. Eventually I’ll do some agentic coding to build a CLI
tool to assist in creating new posts for either style of blog. So
getting them lined up on the same format is a good thing.
