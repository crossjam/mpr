Still no plans for me to get back into social media, but I appreciate
how deeply [Rui Carmo dives into his Mastodon experience][1]:

I will admit a slight interest in the technical underpinnings of [the
fediverse][2], especially [ActivityPub][3] and how information is
disseminated.


Plug here for Carmo’s [Tao of Mac][4] blog. Great technical
information and great writing.
