The [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) folks [put together a little video][1] to better explain their purpose, aims, and goals. Very well executed and it also includes [an announcement of their first hacking contest][2]. Tempted to do some sideline hacking on that dataset just for the Big Data experience. Winning would just be serendipity.
