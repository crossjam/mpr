I'm actually really liking the notion of [remixing AbandonedArt *(AbandonedRemixed?)*][1] and taking it on as a project. But I had to catch myself prematurely optimizing and fiending for new hardware.

New project? Of course I need a new MacBook Air so I can work it on it during all my idle moments. Like that worked out so well before.

Okay, it would be nice to have a new low end, or used laptop, just for this project. Ugh. Can't get much for a measly $250. Besides, I have more important things to spend money on at the moment.

Hey! Let's get an inexpensive desktop box just for the sake of this effort. Wait, we're trying to cut back on stuff this year, not add more.

Howabout this. Get started using The Trusty Ole‘ MacBook. **IF** performance really is an issue then deal with it. If not and the mythical 15"/8 Gb RAM surfaces, reward yourself.

Right answer.
