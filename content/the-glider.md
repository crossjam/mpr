While I probably haven't been officially anointed a hacker, I definitely advocate the [old time hacker ethic][2], and appreciate Eric Raymond's use of [The Glider][3] cellular automata as ["the" hacker emblem][1]. So I've adopted for Mass Programming Resistance.

Besides I figure I have enough hacker cred from providing a patch for `g++` 1.9, using Linux since 0.94 *(a.out vs ELF binaries, fun!)*, and living in Emacs for 30+ years.
