Emacs in general has been a part of my computing life since 1985 when I learned Scheme on [MIT's Hewlett-Packard Chipmunks][2]. When [Lucid forked Emacs][3] their X11 support felt so much better I switched from GNU.

However, this old code piker has been trying to get into the [git distributed version control system][4]. *All the cool kids are doing it!* Git is heavily command line driven, but if you live in Emacs you'd really like some integration. None of the git packages worked well for me and XEmacs.

At work, I decided to give GNU Emacs a test drive, since there seemed to be a [plethora of git packages][5], all developed on GNU Emacs. The [magit package][6] turned out to work pretty well. Plus, for my personal MacBook, I was pleasantly surprised by David Caldwell's [nightly MacOS X Emacs builds][1]. Worked well straight out of the box. GNU Emacs felt like a first class citizen of MacOS X, whereas the available graphical versions of XEmacs were never smooth for me.

The switch is not 100% set in stone, but I'm feeling like it might stick.

Oh I forgot to mention that Steve Yegge's [extended bloviation on XEmacs][7] proved to be the tipper to at least revisit GNU Emacs.
