Except this isn't the same old Suns.

Los Suns went into San Antonio last night and [completed the sweep over the Spurs][1], winning 107-101. What's remarkable to me is the resiliency of this Suns team. [Robin Lopez out][3] for the series? No problem. Down 18 points in [Game 3][2]? No problem. Steve Nash whacked in the face, oddly reminiscent of Robert Horry checking him into the scorer's table? No problem.

The old Suns typically laid down when faced with adversity. These guys recover and battle back. I've always liked Steve Nash and would be really happy to see him in the NBA Finals.

But with the Lakers in the way (probably) I wouldn't bet on it.
