My only win streak of the year. A nice solid victory, although I had to sweat a little on Monday due to extended *gar-bage* time.

I have to give credit to an officemate. Even though we're competing for the final playoff spot in our league, he tipped me off to playing Percy Harvin. You can roll like that when there's no money on the line.

Even so, I was **this** close to benching Harvin on Sunday morning. Missing practice for an “illness” is fantasy-speak for “game time inactive” and zero fantasy points. But I rolled the dice and won big with 33.5 on the ledger. 

Add in Aaron Rodgers 37.5, along with another inspired gamble on Roy Helu for 20.2, and that's 90 points in the till. Everybody else on my team underperformed *(I'm looking at you DeMarco Murray)* but totaled enough to get me to 118.

Per usual my opponent chalked up over 100. I had a 36 point lead going into the Monday game and was feeling confident but slightly nervous. Maurice Jones-Drew was the last player left in the tilt. He hadn't scored over 20 points all season. Jacksonville has been awful this year. No way he goes for 30+.

Still, it's been one of those seasons.

Jones-Drew was over 25 by the end of the third quarter. The Chargers were so far ahead, I had visions of them laying down like dogs for a 60 yard touchdown run or something like that. Thankfully, Blaine Gabbert got a lot of throws, Jones-Drew got some rest, and the clock moved quickly.

The playoffs start for me this week, even if I'm not in the playoffs. I win and my buddy loses, and I'm in. We both win or both lose and I need to outscore him by 60 points. Not gonna happen. He wins, I lose, and it's over. So losing isn't much of an option.

Here. We. Go.
