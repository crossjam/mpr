Still checking for consistency, but it looks like I’ve completed my [mission][2] of grabbing all the currently available [Discogs.com data dumps][1]. Have one more to grab and verify the checksum. Then I should be good to go. 45+ Gb *(compressed)* to romp through.

Oddly, it looks like we’re only getting releases updated for the month of May. Curious.
