Link parkin‘: [Lance][1] is the file format and [LanceDB][2] is the
query engine on top:

> Lance is a columnar data format that is easy and fast to version,
> query and train on. It’s designed to be used with images, videos, 3D
> point clouds, audio and of course tabular data. It supports any POSIX
> file systems, and cloud storage like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.   

...

> LanceDB is an open-source vector database for AI that's designed to
> store, manage, query and retrieve embeddings on large-scale
> multi-modal data. The core of LanceDB is written in Rust 🦀 and is
> built on top of Lance, an open-source columnar data format designed
> for performant ML workloads and fast random access. 

> Both the database and the underlying data format are designed from
> the ground up to be easy-to-use, scalable and cost-effective.
