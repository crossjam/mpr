C’mon @DidTheWizWin! You can do better than that. The Wiz came from double digits down, at the Staples Center, against a fully loaded Lakers with Pau and Kobe. Plus the Wizards went without Bradley Beal, Emeka Okafor, and AJ Price. Only nine guys got in the box score. 

And John Wall showed something with 24 points and 16 assists in 44 minutes under the bright lights.

Weird box score observation. The Wiz totaled only 236 minutes, but by my math every regulation game should have 240. Guessing due to round down of fractional minutes.
