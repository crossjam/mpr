Mostly this is a test drive of the WordPress iOS App. But I'm sitting on my couch watching IFC's butchering of [*Frank Miller's Sin City*][1]. First I've seen it in HD. Still amazed at the cast and the visual style. Make's me want to buy the DVD and the graphical novel boxed set.

And Carla Gugino still looks pretty damn good.

This may be the first movie where I've realized how bad editing for time constraints can be.
