Title: Pelican Plugin Fixes
Date: 2023-08-02
Status: published

Just a quick self-pat on the back for making some fixes to an old
Pelican plugin [pelican_json_feed][1], which I [forked][2] into my own
personal version. 

My [commit][3] just made the plugin compatible with some changes in
the [Jinja templating library][4], that were blocking rebuilds to this
here blog.

Gotta celebrate the wins!!
