I **adore** [Quentin Tarantino's][10] movies. [Pulp Fiction][3] is a personal top fiver. [Reservoir Dogs][4] is excellent and [Jackie Brown][5] is severely underappreciated. The [Kill][7] [Bill][8]s and [Death Proof][6] are somewhat entertaining but fatally flawed. I'll probably see [Inglourious Basterds][9], although I don't have particularly high hopes.

Tarantino's films are amazingly quotable and that's because his characters are always talking. I've known for a long time that his approach to dialog is what fascinated me, but Matt Zoller Seitz and Keith Uhlich of [The L Magazine][1] have put together [a short text essay][2] on dialog from Tarantino movies and an accompanying video essay as support. Said video is embedded below. The combination neatly sums up what I'd tell people I love about these movies.

There are some other Tarantino dialogs, probably not Socratic enough to fit Seitz's bill, that tickle my fancy:

- **Reservoir Dogs**: Mr. White explaining to Mr. Orange various brutal crowd control techniques for a robbery and then ending matter of factly with, "I'm hungry. Let's get a taco."

- **Pulp Fiction**: Fabienne trying to convince Butch pot bellies are sexy, "Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did 'Lucky Star,' it's not the same thing."

- **Jackie Brown**: Ordell explaining to Lewis why he hangs with Melanie even though she's a bit of a flake, "You can't trust Melanie but you can trust Melanie to be Melanie."

*P.S. Two video embeds in a row. Whoohoo! I'm a modern blogger.*
