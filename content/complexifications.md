Keeping with the theme of generative art, previously I linked to an
[old post of mine][1] where, I had replicated another artist’s
work. The inspiration was [Jared S. Tarbell’s][2] piece from
complexifcation.net entitled [substrate][3]. Curious, I went to the
Web to see what had become of Mr. Tarbell.

[Complexification.net](http://complexification.net/) is still alive, although
frozen in time, featuring Java Applets from an era gone by. What do
you expect from 2004-05 though. At least it wasn’t all Flash. 

But I also chanced upon this [somewhat recent interview][4] _(late
August 2020)_ with Tarbell. First off, if I knew Tarbell had started
Etsy I had certainly forgotten. That’s a nice feather in the cap,
presumably leaving some financial runway to pursue whatever. Second,
his backstory was quite interesting. Third, he seems [to still be
practicing][5]! 

What a great gallery. Fuel for replication, emulation, and inspiration.
