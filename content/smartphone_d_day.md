If this report of Clearwire, and presumably Sprint, [widely expanding its WiMAX footprint][1] is true, this summer means D-Day for a new smartphone for me. A reasonable combination of [HTC Evo][2] price, acceptable MiFi fee, and decent Sprint data plan, means I'm on board with them. Otherwise, I'll be looking at [Verizon's Palm offerings][3] with their free tethering.

The [current rumor][4] has the release data for the Evo being June 6th, with the phone costing $200 under contract (probably 2 years). If the monthly bill is south of $100 I'd likely go for it. But I'll wait a month, catch the early reviews, and let the initial bugs shake out. End of July and I'll be a new phone owner.
