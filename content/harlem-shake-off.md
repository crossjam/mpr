Speaking of the Miami Heat, I’m usually immune to Internet memes, but I got sucked in by [the Miami Heat’s version of the Harlem Shake][1]. My Little Guy (™) had to watch it 20 times in a row. Where’s [Andy Baio][3] when we need him?

That’s a lot of high-priced talent having a big old goof. LeBron James seems to really get into it. But what I really want to know is who’s wearing the championship belt? My guess is Joel Anthony, but more investigation is needed.

However, I’m actually somewhat partial to [the Kansas Jayhawks edition][2] which I suspect might have inspired the Heat. *via Mario Chalmers?* Could be a skoosh longer but has the upside of a Bill Self appearance:
