Both discs of Pete Tong and Felix Da Housecat on [*All Gone Ibiza*][5] are solid but don't feel like goto listens. Noisia's [*FabricLive.40*][2] was better than anticipated on second listen, may have to reevaluate. And finally, I thought I would have listened to DJ Heather's [*Tangerine*][6] a little more, but I've really been groovin' on the DnB purchases.
