In [*The Next Data Challenge*][2] I mentioned that there’s some interesting data collection experiments to be run against newer social media systems like [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com). Conveniently, Anil Dash did a deep dive into why he thinks the NYC based startup is at the top of the tech game. I don't use Foursquare at all, so can’t speak to the piece’s veracity, but it’s a good read. And points to why I think Foursquare is worth studying closely.
