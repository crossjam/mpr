I’ve been on a bit of a spending binge over the products from the [Fabric London](http://www.fabriclondon.com) store. When in the mood for some “new to me” music, I trawl their back catalog. To be honest, the purchases have been a combination of buying second market CDs or digital downloads from the Amazon Music Store. Hopefully, this plug will send some purchases their way. But over the course of the past month, I’ve collected over 6 different titles.

The current leader of the pack is [Evil Nine][3]’s [entry][1] into the FabricLive list. The [end-to-end DJ mix][2] is a nice journey into [breaks][4] territory. Opens quite well, dips a little, then really picks up steam near the tail end. Highlights are, *Technologic*, *All I Wanna Do Is Break Some Hearts*, and *Nowhere Girl*. Not to mention an inspired outro with The Clash’s *London Calling*.

The musical style is most reminiscent of stuff from Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, and an incredible one shot effort, [The Dirtchamber Sessions][5], by The Prodigy. Give Evil Nine a whirl if you fancy that particular flavor.
