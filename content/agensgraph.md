Link parkin’: [AgensGraph][1]

> AgensGraph is a new generation multi-model graph database for the modern complex data environment, which supports the relational and graph data models at the same time. AgensGraph supports ANSI-SQL and openCypher. SQL and Cypher can be integrated into single queries in AgensGraph.

AgensGraph is yet another [PostgreSQL derivative][2]. So at this point you could conceivably have one DB engine that has strong relational credibility, [hardened geospatial functionality][3], [support for time series][4] via extension, [semi-structured document data capabilities][5], and at least commercially developed [graph data support][2]. 

Could this be the small to medium data management Rapture? *Ha, ha! Only serious.*
