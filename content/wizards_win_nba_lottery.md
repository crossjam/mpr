That means they have the first pick in a decently deep pool of talent. Speculation is that Kentucky's John Wall be the #1 pick. From what I've seen that wouldn't be a bad choice.

What with [Ted Leonsis becoming the majority owner][3], and now the first pick, things may actually be looking up for the Wizards. What next? Gilbert Arenas playing more than 40 good games in a season?

**Addendum**: The Wizard's have had pretty crappy point guards for a while now so John Wall makes a lot of sense. Earl Boykins is a nice guy and has more bball talent in a fingernail than I've ever had in my entire life, but if he's playing significant minutes your team has serious matchup issues. And no Gilbert Arenas is not a point guard.
