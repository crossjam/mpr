They've informed their educational channels there aren't any more to be had. It's not even clear if Apple had been manufacturing the product at all recently.

Longtime followers (*follower?*) will note that the vast majority of this blog has been written on [one of those MacBooks][2], from the second post up to this very one you're reading. The laptop has been one of the better product purchases I've ever made. In fact, if you have pretty basic computing demands, it's still a good value *now*, three and a half years later on. I'd honestly recommend picking up one on eBay if it's in good condition.

Thanks to This Old MacBook, I can wait patiently for the 15" MacBook Air sporting 8 Gb of RAM and an affordable 500 Gb SSD. Right along with a Unicorn!
