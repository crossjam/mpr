Daemon)][3]*, but I generally enjoyed [*“Nexus”*][1] by Ramez Naam. The technical and philosophical aspects of bio-hacking were well done. I wasn’t particularly fond of the technothriller clash of nation states, American exceptionalism, military/intelligence complex sycophancy tropes, but I knew what I was getting into. At least there was some interesting cultural diversity and introspection in the mix.

I may actually pick up the sequel, *[“Crux”][4]*.
