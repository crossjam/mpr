I love Dr. Seuss.

I have an iPod Touch.

I have a 3 year old, fast going on 4.

[Oceanhouse Media](http://www.oceanhousemedia.com) makes a collection of [Dr. Seuss Apps][1]. These are iOS specific renderings of 11 *(currently)* different Dr. Seuss classics including [*One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish*][2], [*Hop on Pop*][3], and [*The Cat in the Hat*][4]. Each book supports natural reader driven navigation, narrated navigation, and auto played. Curious as to how these are different in actual practice.

Unless the apps are totally awful, and the reviews at the iTunes store are pretty good, I could see eventually buying all of the titles. At $3.99 a pop, that ain't cheap.
