Link parkin’: [XScreenSaver for iOS][1]. From [the Wikipedia entry][2] for the UNIX classic
> XScreenSaver is a collection of about two hundred free screensavers for Unix, Mac OS X and iOS. It was created by Jamie Zawinski in 1992 and is still maintained by him.

Amazing that such an old piece of kit can migrate to such modern platforms.
