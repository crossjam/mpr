What it'll boil down to is either the stylistic selections *(house, downtempo for me)* of the unknown DJs or appearances of top names that I like *([Mark Farina][3], [Heather][4], [Kerri Chandler][5], [Masters at Work][6], [Sneak][7], etc.)*.  Here's the quote from their [About page][2]:

<blockquote><em>

Simply put, Mugasha makes it really easy to listen to Electronic Music podcasts and long sets from world famous DJs. Think of us as Hulu.com for some of the most popular dance music sets in the world. We "chop up" the sets to enable users to easily skip and browse through the songs in each set.

</em></blockquote>

I especially like the "chop up" aspect. I hate those DJ mix podcasts where you basically get big wads of audio and not much more. Plus it looks like they'll have purchase links to the iTMS and Amazon MP3.

One downside of Mugasha is that you can't download the mix sets. Streaming only. Great for the desktop but a lose for your mobile media device. Still, I give them props for the venture which looks like it's being run by folks embedded in DJ culture.

I'll have to give it a whirl and report back.
