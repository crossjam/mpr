Link parkin’: [csvfilter][1] *“a Python command-line tool for manipulating CSV data”*

[pyp][3] *“Pyp is a linux command line text manipulation tool similar to awk or sed, but which uses standard python string and list methods as well as custom functions evolved to generate fast results in an intense production environment.”*

Pyp was even [presented at PyCon 2012][2]. Too bad it was when I was completely knocked from the flu and near fainting in a parking lot. Luckily [the video][4] is on YouTube.

I could of used these a few weeks and months ago, when I was going hot and heavy on the Tweet processing. Probably still useful for the occasional text munging task.
