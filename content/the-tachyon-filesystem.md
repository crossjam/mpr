> [**Tachyon**][1]

> Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed file system enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. It achieves its high performance by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going to disk to load datasets that are frequently read.

> On April 10th, 2013, we put out a soft release of Tachyon 0.2.0 Alpha. The new version is more stable and also features significant performance improvements. It is, however, a soft release and we are working full time towards a full hard release that contains a stable version of the features that we expect will be core to Tachyon. Stay tuned.

And

> **Compatibility**

> Hadoop MapReduce and Spark can run with Tachyon without any modifications.
