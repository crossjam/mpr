[Luke Wroblewski][2] does a great job with **Data Monday** pieces. His most recent was: [*Data Monday: Amazon Prime*][1]. While I don’t think I increased my spending (rate and/or magnitude) at the levels highlighted by his data links, I definitely will buy “higher priced” items. Often for me, when you add in the alternative‘s shipping costs Amazon comes out ahead.

And 2 day shipping just soothes that instant gratification itch so well.

Interesting though that Prime might not actually be a big win for Amazon.
