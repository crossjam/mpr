Title: Python Podcast Recommendations
Date: 2022-05-24

Below are some podcast recommendations for those invested in the
Python ecosystem. 

* [The Python Podcast.\_\_init\_\_][1]
* [Data Engineering Podcast][2]
* [Python Bytes][3]
* [Talk Python To Me][4]
* [PyBites Podcast][7]
* [The Real Python Podcast][6]
* [Software Engineering Radio][8]

The first four were previously listed in my [Favorite Podcasts
2022][5] list. _The Python Podcast.\_\_init\_\__, _Python Bytes_, and 
_Talk Python To Me_ are my gotos, in that rough priority order.

Strictly speaking the _Data Engineering Podcast_ isn’t about Python,
but there’s enough overlap with the ecosystem that a lot of Python
pops up. The _PyBites Podcast_ is mostly specific to participants in
the [PyBites][9] community and [platform][10]. It’s a little more on
the personal and professional development side than straight Python
ecosystem. Oddly enough, even though I’m recommending it and I’m a
paid subscriber on [Real Python][11], I don’t often listen to episodes
from _The Real Python Podcast_. But when I do, I’m highly satisfied.

I just threw in _Software Engineering Radio_ because it hasn’t been
mentioned in this blog yet, but it’s really good and has the
occasional Python bits 😆. 

_Actually, Software Engineering Radio was previously mentioned in
[Deep Diving Podcasts][12]. We regret the error_
