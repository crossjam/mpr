Being a Systems guy, I don’t really know much about ML and AI. In my
attempt to keep up, I’m trying to draft off the best that I know
of. [Andrew Ng][3] is a legend, so I’m subscribed to his [newsletter
"The Batch"][4]. The most recent edition, entitled [_Meet The New Breed of
GenAI Application Engineers_][1] neatly summarizes a lot of what’s
going on beyond the various echo chambers:

> There’s a new breed of GenAI Application Engineers who can build
> more-powerful applications faster than was possible before, thanks
> to generative AI. Individuals who can play this role are highly
> sought-after by businesses, but the job description is still coming
> into focus. Let me describe their key skills, as well as the sorts
> of interview questions I use to identify them. 

> Skilled GenAI Application Engineers meet two primary criteria: (i)
> They are able to use the new AI building blocks to quickly build
> powerful applications. (ii) They are able to use AI assistance to
> carry out rapid engineering, building software systems in
> dramatically less time than was possible before. In addition, good
> product/design instincts are a significant bonus. 

About two years ago, I would have been one to scoff at the notion of
AI Engineers, thinking them as overblown prompt tweakers and API
cobblers. I’ve come around because of two major shifts.

First, systematically, robustly, and safely building capabilities on
top of LLMs really does require engineering. We’ve moved past the
point of just bolting a chat window into an app and calling it a
day. [Compound AI systems][2] (_Go Bears!_) with agentic components
are a whole new ballgame.

Second, the shape and quality of system building is changing. The
baseline velocity of software development is going up. Vibe coding may
lead to crap applications but there are enough folks doing the
required experimentation to lead to better outcomes. Still have
concerns about the security, ops, and maintenance aspects but those
become worthy avenues to provide value.

If you click through on Ng’s newsletter, that list of AI building
blocks is daunting. Good taste on which of them to early adopt, lag, and deep
dive will be another defining skill. As always, those who can discern
the enduring qualities will be well positioned.
