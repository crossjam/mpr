But man, Andre Villas-Boas didn't get much leash in managing  Chelsea. [AVB was sacked this weekend][1] meaning he barely made it 3/4 of a season.

Surprising contrast with Arsenal, where Arsene Wenger's head was on the chopping block after their early season beatdown by ManU. Now the Gunners are challenging for third position in the tables.
