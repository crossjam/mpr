[Cloudera ML][1], at least making [Apache Mahout][2] a bit more usable
> Today, I’m pleased to introduce [Cloudera ML][3], an Apache licensed collection of Java libraries and command line tools to aid data scientists in performing common data preparation and model evaluation tasks. Cloudera ML is intended to be an educational resource and reference implementation for new data scientists that want to understand the most effective techniques for building robust and scalable machine learning models on top of Hadoop.

Good on ’ya Mr. Wills.
