[`uv`][1] is multi-tool for managing various aspects of Python packaging
and deployment. From the docs:

> An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in
> Rust.

Recently, based upon my gestalt reading of the Python media ecosystem
(blogs, newsletters, podcasts, and developer docs), `uv` is on an
extreme upward trend of attention if not adoption. From everything
I’ve heard it feels like the right tooling for this particular moment,
so time to get on board. Stashing a few links for reading up:

Will Kahn-Greene on ["Switching from pyenv to uv"][2]. Pertinent since I’m
currently a heavy user of `pyenv`.

Basic nuts and bolts around `uv` virtualenvs in [uv: An In-Depth Guide
to Python's Fast and Ambitious New Package Manager][3]

> A comprehensive guide on why and how to start using uv—the package
> manager (and much more) that's taken the Python world by storm.

Hynek Sclhawack on [Docker and `uv`][4]. _Bonus videos_ [is it the
future?][5], [it is the future!][6].

Will probably update as more good links get discovered.
