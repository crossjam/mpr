And the football usually sucks. I mean how many Conference USA football games are actually worth watching in any given year?

But the beloved [Golden Bears are playing Nevada][1] tonight. So I have to watch. At least make it worth my while Shane Vereen.

**Addendum.** Also, it's a little odd to see Pac-10 games regularly on ESPN, other than those involving the  University of Spoiled Children and/or Nike University.

**Update.** Well Shane Vereen tried to make it worth my while. Unfortunately, the defense, with an assist from Kevin Riley, didn't. Cal gets smoked 52-31.
