Virgin's gone nuts! Now they're offering [unlimited mobile broadband][1] through their Mi-Fi device for $40 a month. There's no contract required and pay as you go. Nice!

Of course unlimited probably means "not too much over 5GB please or we'll shut you down." But still it's a savory pricepoint. $40 is south of what AT&T charges you for tethering on their data plans. So you can get the upside of Wi-Fi sharing for multiple devices at a lower cost. And relative to tethering the Mi-Fi is probably no more inconvenient.
