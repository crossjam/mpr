Title: My Emerging Knowledge Toolchain
Date: 2023-09-22
Status: published

Due to research demands of my self-imposed sabbatical, I wound up
stacking up a whole bunch of browser tabs across multiple computers,
windows, browsers, etc. It was a bit appalling.

The breadth of the types was outstanding as well. Long form web
articles. GitHub repos of interest. Academic papers from
[arXiv][1]. Academic papers from other places. PDFs from all across
the web. Email newsletters stuck in multiple GMail accounts. And
plenty of plain old web pages for one project of note or another.

Not to mention the bits and bobs trapped in my [RSS feed reader][12] stars
and [my podcast app][11].

I finally got some time this week to sit down and begin dealing with
this knowledge sprawl. There had been some prior investigation on
tools worth picking up and growing into. Here’s where I am at the
moment:

* [Omnivore][2], for stashing long web articles to read later
* [Zotero][3], for academic reference and paper management
* [Zotfile][4], to shift papers from Zotero into a Dropbox folder
* [Pinboard][6], for parking links of interest
* [Goodnotes][5], an app recommended by a colleague for annotating
  PDFs
* Apple’s "Books" app for reading technical books

So far so good. All of these apps bridge macOS and iOS which is great
since I’m deeply wedded to the Apple ecosystem and I especially want
to put my iPad to good use. They also seem to have reasonably decent
browser apps as well. Omnivore and Zotero have solid cross browser
plugin extensions that make it easy to shovel content in directly from
a web page being viewed. For Pinboard, I just do it the old fashioned
way, with a JavaScript bookmarklet. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised
that [saving bookmarks][7] on Pinboard has advanced a bit. Might be
time to try [yet another browser extension][8].

Early doors, but mopping up those open tabs is going to plan. Next I
have to make all that capture productive. Leaning towards pulling
[obsidian][9] into the mix since it has nice integration with
Omnivore. Then I’m contemplating some linkblog experimentation via
various APIs in combination with [Pelican’s][10] static site
generation capabilities. Fun times.
