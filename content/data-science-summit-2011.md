I'm not sure that [*data science*][3] isn't just the tech world buzzword du jour, but I've got a gut that there's something important going on. [David Smith's summary][1] of the [2011 Data Science Summit][2] would seem to support my hunch. Looked like an interesting mix of tech, biz, and art.

Also, [Joe Hellerstein][4] seems to be [working this circuit][5] and he has good taste.
