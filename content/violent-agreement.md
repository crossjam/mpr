I'm in violent agreement with Jason Snell's [thoughts][1] regarding Tim McCarver's recent illness:

> I wish Mr. McCarver a speedy recovery and a healthy, long life. I also wish him a lengthy and joyous retirement.

> By which I mean, Tim, this broadcasting game. It’s too stressful. You have just had a “minor” heart procedure—but how minor can anything regarding your heart be?

> …So Tim. We’re your pals. Quit this broadcasting racket. … 

Might be the best thing I've seen on [American McCarver](http://americanmccarver.com/) yet.
