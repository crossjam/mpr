Ed Hunsinger has the best [explanation of Mac sleep modes][2] that I've seen so far.

The nice thing about Deep Sleep is that it can supplement your default suspend activity for when a Mac laptop lid is closed. You can have the close go to the basic "sleep" mode and clicking on the widget lead to a "hibernate". Very handy.

And the Deep Sleep widget is free to boot.
