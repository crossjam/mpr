[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/bug-pbmt-white.png" alt="#alttext#" border="0" width="120" height="75" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Moved publishing of this weblog over to [Movable Type 5][1]. Things look mostly unbroken. Spooged the Atom feed for a few minutes, thanks to a setting buried away in the user profile that the Atom template slurps up. Need to crawl over the archives and see if anything else has busted.

**Update**. Whoopsie. Forgot to move the actual MT cgi files over. Breakage may still ensue.

**Update 2**. Think I've got it all sorted, but anticipate further bumps.
