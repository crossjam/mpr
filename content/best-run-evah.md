Holy smokes! How the ?!?!!*! did it get to be May already?

Looking at my monthly archives on the right over there tells me I’ve probably had my best posting run ever. Pretty much seven *(7 wow!)* months straight minus a singular brain cramp in early December. 

That's at least one post every day, including weekends and holidays. Through illness, while traveling, while my **wife’s** traveling, when work is bursting, and even when I think I just don’t have anything to say.

It’s been an interesting and worthwhile challenge to tackle, not to mention helping me keep one of my New Year’s resolutions. And there’s more yet to come. Not declaring victory just yet.

Now if I could only apply the same tenacity to a couple of my other resolutions. But it’ll come. I can feel an extended personal hacking run launching this summer.

*Good to check back in on the [resolutions][1]. Some progress made, but more to do.*
