I was probably at my physically fittest in September 2001. Someday I may tell a long 9/11 story that will explain how I know this. Don't worry it's low drama with a happy ending. In the meantime, it has been a long slow decline to sitting on my ass all day and being a good 20 - 30 lbs over my ideal BMI. I'm putting it in pixels here just so the goal can stare me coldly, laughingly in the face.

In the first quarter of the year I'd just be happy to have the exercise ball rolling in a consistent fashion. 3 times a week of 30 - 60 minutes of serious workout and I'll declare victory on that front. I figure after that the habit will have stuck.

By the end of the year, down 20 lbs, although I have higher hopes than that. I've already started tweaking the diet and seeing some small gains. Got to make them stick though.
