As a nominal Wizards fan it was about the best that could be hoped for given Ernie Grunfeld’s ability to pick losers.

I’m not particularly optimistic though. Have a feeling Beal might turn out a bit like Kirk Hinrich. Hinrich was [selected by the Bulls 2 spots after Dwayne Wade][3] who the Bulls coveted. Hinrich so far has had a serviceable yet undistinguished career. Meanwhile there were a few guys picked *(well)* after Kirk that went on to be All-Stars or play on championship caliber teams.

The Wade role this year might be played by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (MKG), unexpectedly taken by the Bobcats in the second spot. Media here in DC ragged on MKG, but he did way more then Beal in his one college season, becoming an integral part of a championship team. This [preview of Kidd-Gilchrist][2] at The Basketball Jones captures my sentiment: 

> Chad Ford of ESPN sums up MKG nicely, writing “Ask anyone who knows anything about basketball what label should adorn Michael Kidd-Gilchrist as he prepares for the 2012 NBA draft and they all, to a man, say the same thing. Winner.”

My guess is that if MKG was still available at the three spot, Grunfeld would still have gone with Beal. Then I’d be really salty. So he escapes my wrath this time.
