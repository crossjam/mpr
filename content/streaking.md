I'm definitely down with [*meta is murder*][1], but small doses aren't fatal. 

Stupidly forgot to post yesterday, ending my 60+ day streak. Simply had a lot of stuff going on at work and home and lost track of time. Adam Fast recently posted on why he was [blogging every day][2] and I greatly sympathize. Which is why I take keeping posting streaks going seriously.

No big deal though, just get back on the horse and start a new streak!
