[Thanks to PC/Mac/Whatever-world][2] for reminding me.

Thinking about what the [*The Road*][3] and [*Neuromancer*][1] have in common, brilliant dialog is central to their power. Gibson developed a whole new language of technology based cultural cool. His dialog imbued seriously nerdy elements with a hipster chic. McCarthy pared down conversations between a father and son, discarding even the quotation marks, to match the bleakness and despair of their situation. The duds I've read recently all had weak, tepid dialog.

Maybe I've become a dialog connoisseur, which might explain the obsession with Tarantino films.

I'm putting the complete [Sprawl trilogy][4] on this year's *to read* list.
