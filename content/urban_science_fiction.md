Read as werewolves, vampires, faeries and other magical folk co-existing with humans (to varying degrees of peacefulness) in Manhattan. In some sense, it's hard to do the same thing with technology driven Science Fiction, since modern urbanity is such a product of technological advances. The mingling of the two is almost tautological.

But I wonder if there's a class of science fiction that treats modern urban structures (read cities or metropolitan areas) as systems that can be hacked. There's lots of SF that happens **IN** cities but is there much SF that happens **TO** cities? Even the good stuff that I've read with a heavy urban element, (*Neuromancer*, *Altered Carbon*, *Brasyl*, etc.) doesn't quite get to where I'm reaching. The city, however well fleshed out, is always backdrop.

While I haven't read it, China Mieville's [*The City & The City*][1] would seem to be an exemplar, although it's essentially a police procedural. Then again I should read it before holding it up as a prototype.
