ArsTechnica with [the overview][1], and AnandTech with [the details][2] on the latest increment on consumer grade price and performance for [SSDs][3]. 960 Gb useable is just a bit short of 1 Tb, but give it year. Then we’ll be well over 1 Tb for 30% less cost.

Just in time for my next laptop purchase ;-)

*And [UltraRAM (PDF warning)][4] is just off the horizon.*
