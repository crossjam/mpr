[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/ESPN HomePage.png" alt="ESPN HomePage.png" border="0" width="281" height="133" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Once upon I time, I swore off [ESPN.com](http://espn.go.com) because they had a way too gaudy home page. Tons of multimedia crap that autoplayed. I switched to [CBSSports.com][2] nee [CBSSportsline.com][3]. Much cleaner.

Times have changed. ESPN has eased up on the multimedia and are way more in line with dense information presentation consistent with other big media sites. CBSSports isn't too bad, but a recent spate of overly aggressive interstitial ads has turned me off. I'm going to give "The World Wide Leader in Sports" a spin for my sports info for a while.

By the way, that CHW vs NYY score you see in my little screen capture is iconic of the White Sox's season swirling down the drain.
