Title: Algorithmic Amplification and Society

I must say, I’ve been enjoying the output from [Arvind Narayanan’s][2]
algorithmic amplification [project][1] at Columbia University: 

> Most online speech today is hosted on algorithmic platforms that are

> Under the direction of the Knight Institute’s 2022-2023 Visiting
> Research Scientist Arvind Narayanan, the Institute will examine how

> markets, or facets of society, and explore ways to modify algorithms
> or design in order to minimize harmful amplifying or distorting effects.  

Still sitting on the social media sidelines, just admiring the
constant conflagration. Glad someone’s digging in to what’s happening
with a modicum of scientific rigor though.
