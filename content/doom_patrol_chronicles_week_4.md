I went 2-2, but really only had one satisfying game. One good blowout win to stay undefeated. Two close losses where I let playing matchups bite me in the butt. Plus one win over an absentee owner.

More after the break

Doom Patrol Prime fell into a five way tie for first, after I lost by only 1.7 points. The killer is that I played Oakland's Darren McFadden in what I swore would be his last game for me. I was hoping he could do something against Houston's (previously) hapless defense. McFadden effectively put up a goose egg. Meanwhile, I sat Dallas' Tashard Coice, who generated a solid 10 points. Ball game.

Frankly, I probably shouldn't have been in that game though. New Orleans' Drew Brees was way under projection. The San Francisco defense bailed me out however, way overperforming and exploding for 39 points.

Doom Patrol Beta rolled, winning by 39 points. The real Steve Slaton (Houston) showed up, Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers had a big Monday Night, and I had the San Fran defense again. Still undefeated and tied for first. 'Nuff said.

Justice Society failed to come through again. Lost by 9, with McFadden doing damage for a second time. Sigh.

The New Mutants won despite only scoring 71 points. Tom Brady was the singular player to reach the endzone. Given the rules of this league, it's hard to win on yardage alone. Meanwhile, the other owner played 4 players on bye. I'm guessing he's not even paying attention to this league anymore.
