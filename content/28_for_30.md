Posted on 28 out of 30 days in September. I just ran out of gas on the days I missed and fell asleep before I could get to posting. Life intrudes.

I'm going to pursue [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net) hacking as [a 100 hours project][1], shooting for about 8 hours per week on average, from here to the end of the year. I'll probably use [a Posterous site][2] just as an activity log, but that should provide more technical grist for this blog.

Posting about football has been a hoot! I'm definitely going to keep that up.
