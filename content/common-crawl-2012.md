Mmmmmmm, [fresh, hot data][1]! With instructions to boot:
> I am very happy to announce that Common Crawl has released 2012 crawl data as well as a number of significant enhancements to our example library and help pages.

> ... 

> Along with this release, we’ve published an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to help both new and experienced users get up and running quickly.  The AMI includes a copy of our Common Crawl User Library, our Common Crawl Example Library, and launch scripts to show users how to analyze the Common Crawl corpus using either a local Hadoop cluster or Amazon Elastic MapReduce.
