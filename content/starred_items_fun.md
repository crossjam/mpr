The combination of starring items and search is really handy.

I didn't realize how long I'd been in the starring game until I downloaded all of my starred items. The earliest item captured was published on Dec 5, 2006. That's just about 2.5 years ago! I also have a grand total of 1713 starred items.

My goal is to get all of these old items into an IMAP folder. Then I'm going to setup an automated script to monitor for new starred items and push them into my GMail account. This should provide me with the ability to search and access these nuggets outside of GReader. I also might be able to do some information retrieval and data mining experiments on these items.
