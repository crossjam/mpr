A bit dusty, but I really enjoyed this O’Reilly Bots Podcast [discussion between Jon Bruner and Tom Coates][2]. Given the potential for a buzzword laden, hype explosion (voice interfaces, IoT, connected home, bots) the conversation was surprisingly thoughtful.

> In this episode of the O’Reilly Bots Podcast, I speak with Tom Coates, co-founder of Thington, a service layer for the Internet of Things. Thington provides a conversational, messaging-like interface for controlling devices like lights and thermostats, but it’s also conversational at a deeper level: its very architecture treats the interactions between different devices like a conversation, allowing devices to make announcements to any other device that cares to listen.

Internet of Things is an area which feels compelling to me, on a number of different tech angles, despite the hype. Still pondering on bots.
