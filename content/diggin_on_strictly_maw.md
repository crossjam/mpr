Man, I had forgotten what classics many of the [Strictly Rhythm][4] tracks were, including:

* **Logic**, *The Warning*. This might have been the first Strictly Rhythm 12" I ever bought. Great flip side too, *The Final Frontier*.

* **Barbara Tucker**, *I Get Lifted*

* **Hardrive**, *Deep Inside*. Deep, deep, deep inside. Deep deep down inside.

* **Underground Solution**, *Luv Dancin*

* **Lil' Mo Yin Yang**, *Reach*

* **The Believers**, *Who Dares to Believe in Me?*. Very underrated. The track that gives and  just keeps on giving.

* **Erick "More" Morillo**, *Dancin*

* **Aly-Us**, *Follow Me*. Although I can't stand this song. I don't need any shower singing in my mix.

Glad to see [the label][5] is back in business.
