Thanks to [stumbling onto the Common Crawl blog][3], I’ve run across sites for [Pete Warden][2] and [Mat Kelcey][1]. Both look like interesting data hacking venues which update at a reasonable frequency. Particularly like Warden’s *Five Short Links* series. Subscribed. May even have to follow them on Twitter.
