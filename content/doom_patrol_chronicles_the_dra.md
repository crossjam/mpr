But it's my blog, so I'll write about it occasionally if I want to.

This season my team is named *Doom Patrol*, following in the heritage of *West Coast Avengers* and [*Green Lantern Corps*][2]. The league I'm in is mostly office folks. A live draft was scheduled for 3 PM this afternoon, which made it a bit tricky, since many people actually still had work commitments. Most of the selections actually wound being autopicked.

Meanwhile, yours truly tried to sneak out for a beverage and hand picked selections. Problem is, I forgot the power cord for my personal laptop, said lack being discovered 5 minutes before the draft started. This led to a frantic dash to the local library and the expedient usage of a public workstation.

To make matters even worse, I got the 13th pick out of 14 teams. Luckily it was a snake (order reversed every other round), so I had a fighting chance. Unfortunately, I missed my first two picks and completely blew my strategy of picking up a couple of second tier lead running backs. Instead I wound up with Drew Brees and Randy Moss.

It could be worse.

Herewith are the initial members of *Doom Patrol*, by round, overall rank in parens:

1.	(13)	Drew Brees, NO QB
2.	(16)	Randy Moss, NE WR
3.	(41)	Darren McFadden, OAK RB
4.	(44)	Marshawn Lynch, BUF RB
5.	(69)	Eddie Royal, DEN WR

10.	(128) Donald Driver, GB WR
11.	(153) Hakeem Nicks, NYG WR
12.	(156) Washington, DEF

Yeah, I know Marshawn Lynch is suspended for three games. I'm hoping Jamal Lewis can stay healthy and productive for that period of time. And I'll dump one of the WRs for a kicker on Saturday.

I'm looking forward to the start of Fantasy season as much as real college football and the start of the NFL.
