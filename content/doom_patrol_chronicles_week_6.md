Rest assured, I'll return to some other regularly scheduled programming shortly.

In this week's episode, I go 3-1 and every team is now at .500 or better. Even my worst teams are still in the muck for a fantasy playoff spot.

I was still disappointed.

Way too long analysis after the break. Non-fantasy heads can stop here.

Despite winning a matchup I thought I was going to lose, I was disappointed that I lost a match I thought I was going to win. Mainly because it was my sole undefeated team. Oh well!

Doom Patrol Prime was a slight underdog, but I was feeling pretty good. For whatever reason, the Yahoo! projection algorithm typically undervalues New Orleans' Drew Brees by a touchdown. Needles to say when he lit up the Giants in the first half my confidence went up. This team also has New England's Randy Moss, beneficiary of 3 of Tom Brady's 6 touchdown passes. Two guy's going for 30+ points apiece makes for a short path to victory.

Interestingly, this team is in sole possession of second place despite a horrible draft. I missed the first two picks but had done my own rankings so I wound up with Drew Brees and Randy Moss. Then I started picking: Darren McFadden, Marshawn Lynch, Eddie Royal, Matt Hasselbeck, Jamal Lewis, Visanthe Shiancoe, Washington DEF and Hakeem Nicks. Only Marshawn Lynch remains and he's only played one game. Some of those guys contributed here and there, but that's pretty pathetic. I did pick up Ahmad Bradshaw and Donald Driver late and they've been good supporting mainstays. Combined with Brees and Moss I've got a solid core and have been working the waiver wire like a champ.

Doom Patrol Beta, formerly undefeated, was a solid favorite. Three of my guys underperformed, including the Cardinals' disappointing Anquan Boldin. I'm about to hit the panic button on him. Meanwhile, six of the opposing team's players overperformed, including the Jag's Maurice Jones-Drew for 30+. Ball game. Still tied for first in this league, although I lose the tie break.

In the ESPN League, Justice Society has crawled back to 3-3. The Panthers' DeAngelo Williams did the main damage. Two nice waiver pickups, the Broncos D/ST and tight end Tony Scheffler, were also big contributors.

In this league, there's one 5-1 team, one 1-5 team, and everyone else is 3-3. For whatever reason I hold a divisional tie break, so I'm actually second in the division. Good enough for the third playoff seed. Surprising given my poor draft position for this team.

The New Mutants of the NFL.com league were favorites. By the end of the 1 o'clock games I was down by 20 points and nervous. At the end of 4 PM first quarter, the gap was widening. Then Tom Brady and Wes Welker went to work. By the end of the 4PM first half, I was up by 40. In about a 30 minute span, wall clock time, I went from around 60 points to 110 points. My opponent only had 1 remaining Monday night player, and he wasn't making up those 40 points.

This team has a slim lead, on a points tie breaker, for the sole wild card playoff spot. However, my team is shaping up to be pretty strong down the stretch. Despite having the only current undefeated team in my division, there's still a chance I could win it.

In all of the leagues, this upcoming week is essentially the half way mark of the season. I feel like I'm in good position with three teams and have a fighting chance with the fourth to make the playoffs

But I'd only bet my own money that one of the four will make it. It's fantasy football, anything can happen!
