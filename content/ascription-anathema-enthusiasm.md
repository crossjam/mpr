I am definitely glad that [Ben Hyde][1] has [gotten back to posting][2] at [“Ascription is Anathema to Enthusiasm”][3]:
> I think the blog is back now. Six months ago it got hacked, in a very minor way; but I was very busy at the time. When my repair attempts stumbled it went onto the back burner. Something weird about mysql character set encodings, or word press evolution’s in that area. In short when I exported the database and then initialized a new one with the exported data things got wonky.

Sorry about the job, but glad to see an old grizzled Lisp veteran bringing his perspective again.
