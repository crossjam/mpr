[*1999*][4] and [*Purple Rain*][5] were just as important to me as Michael Jackson's *Thriller*. I lost the vibe around the time of [*Lovesexy*][3] though, and never came back around.

My sister dropped Prince's [*Ultimate*][1] on me as a Christmas present. I finally ripped the tracks to my iPod last week and have been enjoying it immensely. It's definitely flawed, although I don't quite agree with the Discogs.com reviewer that it's "A real half-assed effort,..." Short edits of *When Doves Cry* and *1999* are criminal. And for someone like Prince, there's always other stuff you wish was in the compilation, e.g. *Erotic City*, *Another Lonely Christmas*, *Anotherloverholenyohead*, and a personal favorite of mine: *D.M.S.R.*

Having said that, some of the extended remixes are definitely worth having. *Controversy*, *Let's Go Crazy*, and *Kiss* are particularly good. And I always enjoyed *Pop Life*, but the *Fresh Dance Mix* is new to me and a really good variation. Oddly, the dance remix for *Little Red Corvette* didn't really work to my ears. The album version was just the right serving.

Of course now I'm starving for more. May have to take a trip to the MP3 store for  *1999*. I mean how can you live without *Lady Cabdriver*, *Automatic*, and *International Lover*?
