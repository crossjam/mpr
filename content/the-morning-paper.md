If you like the computer science research stuff that shows up here, you should subscribe to Adrian Colyer’s [*The Morning Paper*][1] blog. 

The tagline:
> an interesting/influential/important paper from the world of CS every weekday morning, as selected by Adrian Colyer

While Adrian’s selections tend towards the  systems literature, he does foray into other important areas such as security, machine learning, and software engineering. He’s entertainingly eclectic. 

I have 56 posts from his blog starred in my feed reader *(yup, still use one, actually two)*. A bit of a retrospective look at those starred items could make for some good fodder.

*By systems literature, I mean computer architecture, operating systems, networking, programming language design and implementation, databases, and distributed systems. Staples of a Berkeley grad CS education.*
