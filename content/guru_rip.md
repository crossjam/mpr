[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Gang Starr.jpg" alt="Gang Starr.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="200" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] [Gang Starr][1], was definitely a distinctive part of the late 80's-early 90's, positive hip hop movement. Besides DJ Premier's great mixing and cutting, Guru (seen at right in the adjacent photo) had both a unique lyrical style and unique vocal sound. Together Guru and Premier epitomized the intersection of Hip-Hop and Jazz.

Herewith, some of their best tracks:

* [*Words I Manifest*][2]

* [*Jazz Thing*][3]

* [*Who's Gonna Take The Weight?*][4] *(I was raised like a Muslim / Prayin' to the East)*

* [*Step In The Arena*][5]

* [*DWYCK*][6] *(Leaving the bodega I say suave / Premier's got more beats than barns got hay)*

* [*Take It Personal*][7]

* [*Mass Appeal*][8]

[Guru has passed on][9], after a long battle with cancer. He was my age. His death, [along with Malcolm McLaren's][10], seems like the beginning of the end for an era of Hip-Hop that highly influenced me. An era before pimps and hoes, n\*s and b\*s, ghetto fabulous and bling, took over the main stage. An era when Hip-Hop held a little more dignity for the Black man.

Godspeed kind sir.

*And whatever this [beef][11] is between Guru, Solar, and Premier, it's whack! Kill the noise.*
