Title: Revisiting Zenbullets

Another activity I’d like to get back into is [generative art][6]. I’ve
always admired the [processing][8] ecosystem and community. There was even
an extended period where I was [a quite serious dabbler][7] in using Python
to replicate various works. In particular, Matthew Pearson, a.k.a
zenbullets, released a book entitled [Generative Art][2] and published a
site [Abandoned Art][1]. I recently decided to see what Pearson was up
to these days. Apparently he’s abandoned working in this arena, but
there are still vestiges of his work online. 

Having squatted on the [domain adoptedart.org][3] _(currently
redirects to [mpr.crossjam.net][5])_ intending to recreate the
works in Abandoned Art, I’ve got some Internet real estate to build a
portfolio in this space. Just need to get stuck into it.

Interestingly, only screen captures of the abandoned works are
available from Pearson’s current site. With a little digging in on
the [Wayback Machine][4], maybe the source code can be recovered.
