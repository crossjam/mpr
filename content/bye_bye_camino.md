When I moved into <a href="http://crossjam.net/mpr/2008/08/happiness-is-a.html">the new digs</a>, our fling was pretty hot. As time went on, memories of the old <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Foxy mama</a> kept creeping back in.

She always was <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1368">colorful</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122">memorable</a>, and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox">really, really flexible</a>. While we were taking time off, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/392160/top-10-firefox-3-features">she got faster, and more user friendly</a>, not to mention better at safe surfing. She moved back in today.

Sorry it didn't work Camino, but hey, every guy likes a freak in the bedroom.
