Washington Business Journal is reporting that Clearwire has unleashed [WiMax coverage in the Washington DC area][1]. That's the service behind Sprint's, and the HTC Evo's, 4G capabilities. Makes that smartphone even more tempting.

The odd thing is that the coverage map doesn't hit my home, but seems to cover a lot of other places around the metroplex where I spend a lot of time. Actually, it's not odd considering how far west I live.
