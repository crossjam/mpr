I know I’m a bit late to the party, but poor [Ozzie Guillen got let go][1] in what may be an MLB first. The Marlin’s posted his firing on Twitter:

Yikes! Amongst Chicagoans, there will always be a soft spot for Oz though, thanks to that [2005 World Series][2]. But I had a feeling it would end badly, from the day he signed on.

*P.S. More evidence that it’s all just **media** now. Now need to use that anachronistic “social media”.*
