Here's their <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=mass+programming+resistance+blogurl:http://crossjam.net/mpr/&scoring=d">post history for Mass Programming Resistance</a>. There's a whole week of January missing.

What's wack is that the main Google search engine actually has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&pwst=1&q=site:crossjam.net+mass+programming+resistance&start=0&sa=N">said missing posts indexed</a>. Not to mention <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/http%3A%2F%2Fcrossjam.net%2Fmpr%2Fatom.xml">Google Reader</a>. Frankly both of the sibling properties of Google Blog Search are scary in how fast they visit after I post.

WTF?! Sibling rivalry?

My suspicion is that there might have been some ping wonkiness, as I remember a couple of entries leading to duplicate posts that may have made me look like a spammer. But I'm not going to put a lot of effort into figuring this one out. Got better things to do.
