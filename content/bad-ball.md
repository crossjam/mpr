Of the seven NBA games on Saturday, March 9, six had a victory margin of 10 or more points. That’s the league’s definition of a blowout I believe. The Knicks-Utah game was over in 6 minutes. The Wizards even got a laugher over the Bobcats, who look horribly awful.

Plus the Caps got blown out by the Islanders. Georgetown crushed Syracuse. North Carolina stunk it up, on their home court, on Senior Night, against Duke. Man City won 5-1 in their FA cup match. Tiger Woods is starting to pull away in the PGA Tour stop. 

Sunday was looking sort of weak as well, with Man United going up 2-0 early in the first half against Chelsea. At least The Blues got their act together, turned it on in the second half, and put a lot of exciting pressure on the Red Devils. 

Thankful for a taste of quality this weekend. Maybe they’re saving up for NCAA Conference tournaments and March Madness.
