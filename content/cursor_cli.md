I’ve heard a lot of good things about [Cursor][2], but thought it was
another IDE with AI inside. And I am **not** an IDE guy.

Turns out [Cursor has a CLI][1]! From [the docs][3]:

> Cursor CLI lets you interact with AI agents directly from your
> terminal to write, review, and modify code. Whether you prefer an
> interactive terminal interface or print automation for scripts and
> CI pipelines, the CLI provides powerful coding assistance right
> where you work. 

[Claude Code][4], [Codex CLI][5], [aider][6], [Gemini CLI][7], and Cursor CLI. The quiver
is getting mighty full. Time to get back to work.
