[Data Machina][1] is a weekly link newsletter on AI/ML topics broadly
construed. It’s distinctive in the variety of areas it touches on (
e.g. specific language sections for Python, Scala, Lisp/Clojure, R,
plus segments on datasets and distributed systems),
along with the sheer number of links. I was [enjoying the content][2] way
back when it started out on [TinyLetter][3], but it went on hiatus and
thence behind a paywall, so effectively disappeared from my radar.

Also, yet another plug for [feedreading email newsletters][4]. The
latest versions of Data Machina quietly popped up in my feeds
unannounced. No muss, no fuss. Just back to reading the high quality
linkfest in its best habitat for me.
