Haven't finished working through them, but these git intros feel pretty useful. Slideshare alert if you’re allergic.

*[Introduction to git][2]* is by the venerable [Randal Schwartz][4]. Got a little dust. If up to typical Schwartz standards, still well worth reading.

Lemi Orhan Ergin’s *[Git branching Model][1]* might be overly stylish, but looks like it goes into detail on merging in addition to branching.

*Via [Rajiv Pant][3].*
