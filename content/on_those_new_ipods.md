Unfortunately, it doesn't look like they have [the right song][2] cued up.

I've said before I love [my Nano 4G][3], but the new features of the iPod Nano 5G are tempting. The bigger screen and the FM receiver are the key attractors for me. The video recording and new colors I could do without. *Wouldn't a combination of iPod and XM/Sirius receiver be cool? It would beat the heck out of those crappy radios Sirius sells.*

However, there are two other things higher on my technolust list. First, the [Verizon MiFi][4] is #1 on deck. I just find myself with too many short time windows where I could take advantage of my laptop and a little connectivity. And getting free of the need for a Starbucks or the library would be especially nice.

Second, I'd really like to checkout the iPhone App Store. Now I don't actually want an iPhone, but I can get the App Store experience using an iPod Touch. I was pretty much set even before [the most recent Touch announcements][5]. The price point I was targeting now gets you 32 GB, plus the new features. At that storage level, I can get almost all of my iTunes library onto the iPod.

So as much as I like the new Nano, it'll have to wait. Frankly, it would be gluttony, so I don't think one is in my near future.
