The mix from this CD doesn't have quite the highs (or lows) of *The Dungeonmaster's Guide* but it's really consistent high energy DnB. Technically mixed by Evol Intent, highlights include Styles of Beyond's *Subculture*, Evol Intent + Ewun's *The Rapture*, and Dieselboy + Technical Itch on *Atlantic State (Gridlok Remix)*.

Just a good, hard, dark, twisty ride over some rugged beats and some nasty synth lines. Gets the feet tappin' and the head noddin'
