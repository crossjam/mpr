And it borked my alpha of [Tweetbot for Mac][4] *(fixed)*. May just be age, but I’m hoping there’s a pending os update to fix some obscure issue.

I upgraded my iPhone 4 to iOS 6 and now I think I’m suffering [the battery life issues][1] many others have been seeing. Haven’t done a scientific investigation, and an uptick in audio streaming over 3G may be responsible, but still irritating.

Not really Apple’s fault but …, I went to the AT&T store a day after the iPhone 5 launch to put in my order. Okay, it’s going to take 3-4 weeks, but I’m a patient guy. However, it shouldn’t take me 30 minutes to get a hold of a sales rep and complete the pre-order. Yikes!

And then there’s [that maps issue][2].

Stuff used to “just work”.
