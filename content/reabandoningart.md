Since, I've got the honest-to-gosh physical book, I'm trying actually read all of it end to end. Have to admit, the long preface and first chapter were a bit of a slog. But then I didn't really need any convincing that generative art is art and is worth exploring. Nice color plates though. Now I'm working my way through chapter 2 even though it's terminally remedial for me.

Pearson's [AbandonedArt.org][2] was an interesting find though, given my [100Hours project][3] that I eventually [abandoned][4]. Pearson had a little more focus and determination, completing his goal of 100 [Processing](http://processing.org) sketches.

He also had the foresight to put most of his code under a Creative Commons license. I had a notion that taking each piece, shoving it into a [GitHub](http://github.com/) repository, and tweaking from there would be a worthwhile effort. A combination of working on generative art skills and DVCS skills. Plus you could see various artistic paths preserved for others to fork.

Sounds like a plan.
