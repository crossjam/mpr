Someone gave the Oklahoma City Thunder a defensive transplant in their [victory over the San Antonio Spurs][1] last night. They needed to hit some clutch shots to close out the win, but there were some periods of the game where the Spurs looked inept offensively. And the Spurs were the league’s team scoring average leader!

A few folks have already, prematurely, anointed them as series victor, but it definitely feels like a changing of the guard in the Western Conference.
