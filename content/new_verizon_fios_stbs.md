Looks like Verizon is [upgrading its settop boxes][1], especially the channel guide. Glad to see Engadget also had some [issues with the current boxes][2], although they liked it overall.

I've [lodged][3] my [complaints][4] before. Just wondering if the changes will show up before I kick FiOS TV to the curb.
