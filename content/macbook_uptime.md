One of my favorite quips these days is "Rebooting is so last century." A particular joy of my MacBook is that unintended reboots/crashes have been really infrequent. Granted, I'm not pushing it hard like a real developer, but on the other hand I do a couple of sleeps/suspends a day. I also keep a nice bevy of applications open at all times, including three browsers with plenty of tabs. There's plenty of room for hard crashes.

As for my ancient Dell laptop for work? Not so much.

Combine the low crash rate with a reasonable OS update frequency and you get the kind of uptimes seen in the screenshot above. 52 days and I could have gone longer if the last.fm scrobbler hadn't gotten borked by an iTunes update. A voluntary reboot was needed to get things right, along with updating Safari.
