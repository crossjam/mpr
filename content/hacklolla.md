Neat. The venerable [Lollapalooza][3] concert festival has [an API for festival data][1]. They're sponsoring [a contest for best applications][2] built on the API.

> *Lollapalooza is offering over $5,000 worth of prizes and tons of promotional exposure for the best mobile, web and desktop apps created using their API. Developers can access data on artists, events, stages/venues and updates for Lollapalooza 2011. Prizes will be awarded for apps that help fans get the most from their Lollapalooza experience before, during and after the Festival. Winners will be promoted on the official Lollapalooza website and to fans via email, Facebook, Twitter, and the jumbotron screens at the Festival.﻿*

> *Lollapalooza is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with a line-up of 130 of the most notable and buzzworthy bands from across the globe, including Eminem, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Muse, and many others. The Festival is August 5-7 in Grant Park, Chicago.﻿*
