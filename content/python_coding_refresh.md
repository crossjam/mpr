title: Python Coding Refresh
status: published

While I’ve been writing Python code for a while, and even some for my
current job, I feel like I’ve sort of lost the pure coder
mentality. Work projects don’t involve building fully maintained
apps. There’s just lots of little piecemeal components with a lot of
quick and dirty hackery. Plus, I’m not up to date on a lot of the
newer Python 3 changes and best practices. Don’t get me wrong, I’m
totally proficient n Python, but not really a modern coder.

So I’m link parkin’ a few resources to start working with, as a marker
for future motivation:

* [PyBites][1] and it’s companion [coding challenge platform][2]
* Similarly [LeetCode][3] but with more focus on coding interview
  questions [_via Steven Heidel with guidance on application_][4]
* Reuven Lerner’s [Python Workout][5] book and [Weekly Python
  Exercise][7] course
* Ken Youens-Clark’s [Tiny Python Projects][6] book
* [David Beazely online courses][8] or his [open source version of
  _Practical Python_][9]

Quoting Reuven Lerner:
> So what are these resources missing? What is it that’s going to take you from a “good enough” Python programmer to a fluent one that has full command of the language?

> Practice. The very sort of practice I offer in Weekly Python
> Exercise.

I think I’m really out of **practice**.
