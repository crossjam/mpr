Ever since I stopped my personal Twitter data collection project, I’ve been mentally casting about for a new dataset to build my Mad Data Skillz ™ (*Boyeeeee!*). Obviously, just restarting the tweet inflow is an option, but something involving more scale with less work would be nice.

Enter [Common Crawl][1], a non-profit making a large -- 5 Billion Web page -- crawl publicly and freely available on Amazon EC2. How juicy! A big dataset conveniently located within the premier, openly available, utility computing infrastructure in the world. Definitely has potential to put the Skillz to the test. Common Crawl even has [a convenient series of blog posts][2] instructing one on how to process their page repository.
