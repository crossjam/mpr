> Music Library Exporter allows you to export your library and
> playlists from the native macOS Music app.

> The library is exported in an XML format, and is compatible with
> other applications, services, and tools that rely on the Music
> (previously iTunes) XML library format.

** 🎉 🎊 🥳 BONUS!! CLI SUPPORT 🥳 🎊 🎉 **

> Aside from the main Music Library Exporter application, this project
> also includes a command-line program called library-generator.

Now licking my chops for some serious Music.app automation, although
I’m a little nervous about compatibility. Will give it a test drive
and report back.
