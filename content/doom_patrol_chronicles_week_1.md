Doom Patrol rolled this fantasy weekend, racking up a league leading 142.5 points. Chris Johnson, Tom Brady, and Wes Welker were the big performers, each going for over 20 points. Everyone else on my team, including my kicker and defense, went for double digits. Except for Calvin Johnson, who was robbed.

The great thing about this win is that I used the optimal lineup, so there were no points left on the bench.

The scary thing about this win, is that my opponent left Arian Foster and Pierre Thomas on the bench, who scored 42.3 *(yes you read that right)* and 16.1 points respectively. His optimal lineup would have beat me, so in some sense I benefit big from an opponent's mistake. Then again, it's really hard to sit the Falcon's Michael Turner who was on his roster, so it's not clear that any reasonable person would have played that optimal lineup.

Onward and upward. This coming week all of my players face tough defenses, so getting a victory will be a bit of a challenge.
