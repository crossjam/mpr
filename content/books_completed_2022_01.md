Arguably a light haul for January, but still off to a better start
than last year at this time.

Thoughts below the fold...

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> 

_The Numbers Game_ provides convincing evidence that the combination
of football’s rare event nature and continous play makes it well nigh
impossible to bend to analytics. But really when _The Numbers Game_
was written, it was just the end of the beginning. Many of the
characters appearing in _Football Hackers_ make early appearances here
as a community of advanced analytics folks start tackling everything
from match play to training to transfers. A bit more enjoyable than
_The Expected Goals Philosophy_.

_La Roja_ was my second dip into Spanish football history, after _Fear
and Loathing in La Liga_. This followed the stock playbook of "here’s
when the British landed, brought the game, and we move chronologically
forward until some momentous national football event." In this case
the story crescendoes at the 2010 World Cup where Spain lifts the
trophy. Hat tip to a posession oriented team filled with players from
Guardiola’s Barcelona. _La Roja_ did do justice to a wider swath of
the Spanish clubs than _Fear and Loathing..._

_Exhalation_, as the number of Hugo Award mentions on the Wikipedia
page illustrates, is a collection of **great** speculative fiction
short stories. Hard to pick one as best, but the construction and
execution of the titular short story is amazing. Chiang is so worth
reading because his science fiction is leisurely unhurried, generally
void of violence, thought provoking, and reflective of our current
selves. Plus it has sentences I wish I had written.

_Apropos Elle Driver: "You know, I’ve always liked that word
... titular ..., so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence"_
