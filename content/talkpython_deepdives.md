Michael Kennedy has added [Episode Deep Dives][1] to [Talk
Python][2].

The quick look is really good. Kennedy doesn’t go into depth on how
they’re created (_"Each one of these deep dives does take some time
and work to generate."_), but I suspect there’s some LLM machinations
in there, supplementing a bit of manual human labor. Even so, dives
already exist for over a year’s worth of episodes.

I also listened to the embedded "conversation". My curiosity was
piqued as to the participants whose identities weren’t provided. It
was pretty entertaining and provocative for about 10 minutes and then
it got repetitive. Also, none of the speakers actually mentioned names
and at a few points I was confused whether there were two or three
distinct voices. I’m pretty sure it’s an [AI generated audio
overview][3], ala NotebookLM. Whatever it was, a couple of interesting
notions around automatic content generation and community
building. Needed some editing.

Looking forward to taking advantage of these deep dives, a behind the
scenes Talk Python episode, and the proliferation of the feature to
other podcasts.
