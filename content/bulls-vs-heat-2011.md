I normally just root for "good game", but this time I'm on Derrick Rose and the Bulls' side.

When I lived in Chicago, I got the tail end (the Last Dance 97-98 season) of the Jordan Bulls, the dark days of the [Dickey Simpkins][2]/[Kornell David][1]/[John Starks][3] era, and the unfulfilled potential of Elton Brand, Jay Williams, Tyson Chandler, Eddie Curry, et. al. I even had a partial season ticket plan during the dark days, when they picked up [Jalen Rose][5]. So I feel well within my rights to root for the Bulls, even though I live in DC and go to a lot of Wizards games. 

Besides, I have to live with my wife, who's a born and raised Chicagoan. And I really like Derrick Rose.
