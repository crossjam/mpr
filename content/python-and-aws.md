Link parkin': Mitch Garnaat, the author of the [boto][2] toolkit, has finished an O'Reilly book [*Python & AWS Cookbook*][1]. Given my tweet collection hacking, looks like it might be useful with its focus on EC2 and S3.

I recently bought a bunch of O'Reilly e-books on Python and MongoDB. What's one more on the stack?

Garnaat's [blog][5] is probably also a good catch and worth a subscription. For example, he's got [a tutorial on multi-part S3 uploads][3], which I was [having trouble with previously][4]. So I wound up using Cyberduck. Now I can see how to do it right.
