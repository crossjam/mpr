Memo to self, check back in with [processing](http://processing.org). Looks like there are some big upcoming changes. Time to give up on the "processing in Python" dream and learn to love the best possible tool. I pulled the trigger on Matt Pearson's [*Generative Art*][1] which should kickstart the process.
