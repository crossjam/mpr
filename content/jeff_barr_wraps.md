Way [back in the day][2], I linked out to Jeff Barr, AWS’s first
blogger. He’s been at it forever on behalf of the public cloud
provider, but I was following even before that. In the early days of
RSS, I was into what he was doing with [syndic8.com][3].

Now [Barr is moving on][1] after 20 years. A commendable run. I always
admired his writing as extremely competent, technical, accessible,
human, and gracious.

> It has been a privilege to be able to “live in the future” and to

> last two decades: message queuing, storage, on-demand computing,
> serverless, and quantum computing to name just a few and to leave
> many others out. It has also been a privilege to be able to meet and
> to hear from so many of you that have faithfully read and
> (hopefully) learned from my content over the years. I treasure those
> interactions and your kind words, and I keep both in mind when I
> write.

While Barr was blogging about S3 in its early days, I had [a few
things to say][4] about the service.

> Just a few thoughts on Amazon's new web service S3, which is cheap,
> reliable, plentiful Internet based storage.
>
> S3 is not a game changer.

That didn’t age well.

_Bravo AWS for avoiding bitrot on [this 18 year old link][5]_.
