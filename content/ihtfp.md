Classic Institute.

[According to Wired][1], Dr. Who might have paid a visit to MIT's 6.01. As a 6-3 alum, I have to quibble with Annalee Newitz's  *"the infamously hard and awesome introduction to computer science class."* Awesome? Yes! Infamously hard? No. Famously well taught, so that many folks from other majors would take it? Definitely.

**Update**: [Better story][5] via MIT itself. *The Doctor: 1 / Harvard: 0*.
