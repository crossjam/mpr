I'm a believer in [meta is murder][2] for blogging, but I'll take a brief minute to violate the rule in this space.

My posting streak actually ended!

At first, I thought this past weekend was the death knell. I'm Mr. Mom for a while with my wife out of town on business travel. On Saturday, I lounged around watching college football, then went to an evening affair held by some family friends. My little guy got to run around a bit in the dark and burn off some energy. By the time I got home it was midnight.  C'est la vie!

Subsequently I felt a distinct lack of motivation on Sunday. Ergo, I mentally declared the streak officially **ovah**.

However, now looking back at the [Mass Programming Resistance][1] archives, I apparently didn't post on September 6th. I'd originally intended to end the streak on Memorial Day, but deluded myself into thinking I'd shot past that day.

If my math is correct, I'll have to really comb the archives to make sure, I put in 191 days straight. Not bad considering holidays, work crush, and the general random intrusions of life. Time to start a new one ... maybe after New Years.
