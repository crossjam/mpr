The upcoming NBA Finals is intriguing though, with a Celtics-Laker rematch of the 2008 Finals. Despite having home-court advantage and Kobe Bryant, it's unclear who is the favorite in this series. While seemingly challenged in the Western Conference, the Lakers haven't gone more than 6 games this year. It also feels like they have a bit more talent than the Celtics. Meanwhile, the Celtics have been on a roll and their defense has rounded back into 2008 form.

I'll take the Lakers winning it in a close game 7, although I'm a little nervous going against Tim Legler, who has the Celtics in 6. He's been on target with his predictions much of the postseason.

**The Lakers are the 2009-10 NBA Champions.** Game 7 was a grinder affair, but pretty tense. Still doesn't make up for [the tepidness of the rest of the playoffs][1]. Heck, I didn't even find any of The Finals games particularly dramatic. Contrast with Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals.

ABC/ESPN what's up with having Magic in the booth, then going all Laker fanboy on the podium? Un-pro-fessional. Hey LA, I don't care who you're a fan of, you don't boo Bill Russell. *ABC had to lay on the 7 second delay tonight didn't they?*

And Ron Ron Artest has a ring. Long way from the Malice in the Palace. He still crazy though.
