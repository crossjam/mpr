[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/), who stays way more up to date on this stuff than I do, is making some [reasoned projections][1] on changes to Apple's MacBook lineup. The dream of the 15" Screen/8GB RAM/250GB SSD seems a bit more promising. I'm actually seeing more and more reports of the current line of MacBook Air processors being quite comfortable for computationally intensive activities, which is where I would have been willing to compromise.
