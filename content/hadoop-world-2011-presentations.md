Link parkin': A fairly comprehensive collection of slides and videos from the [Hadoop World 2011 program presentations][1] have been posted directly to the Hadoop World site. Also as a straightforward [list of materials][3] on Cloudera's site, with registration required.

Hadoop World 2012 in the Fall is fairly attractive.
