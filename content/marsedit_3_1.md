For me, it's a very [evolutionary step][3], since I primarily use Markdown for formatting and don't have heavy media needs. The scheduled media attachments feature is probably the biggest addition for me. Post editing can now function completely offline.

Still, the fit and finish seems like a notch above, and nothing busted. And while it's probably because I'm using MovableType 5, posting seems much zippier. I'll give MarsEdit 3 a little credit there.

Oh, and I anted up the $14.95 for the upgrade. Support your friendly indie Mac developer.
