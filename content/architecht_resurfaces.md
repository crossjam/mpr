I’ve been subscribing to RSS feeds, text and podcasts, forever. As
expected various of them go dark on occasion. I still stay subscribed
though, just in case.

A few years ago, a favorite podcast of mine was [The Architecht
Show](https://architechtshow.com), by Derrick Harris. At the time he
was covering the emerging “cloud native” space and had a lot of great
interviews. I suspect he could never find sustainable sponsorship and
so had to go on hiatus to make ends meet with a serious day job.

But now [he’s back!][1]. Just popping up in [my podcatcher
(Overcast)][2] as if he’d never been away.

> The Architecht Show returns (!) with Replicated co-founder and CEO
> Grant Miller talking about how his company is enabling KOTS, or
> Kubernetes-Off-the-Shelf software. We dive into a number of topics
> around this, including the pitfalls of relying too heavily on SaaS,
> the popularity of Kubernetes itself, and how laws like Europe's GDPR
> are forcing companies to rethink how and where they manage user
> data.

Welcome back [Derrick][3]!
