“You thought I was doughnut. You tried to glaze me.”

The funny thing about the iconic [*Paid In Full*][1] album is that I always found the album version of [*Eric B. is President*][2] ultra irritating. I was lucky enough to purchase the 12" single well before the album came out. The single cut didn’t have that annoying grinding sound all over it. It was just the simple beat, Eric B. scratching, and Rakim’s dynamically unique rap style. That’s [the real track][3] to me. 

*30 years!! Damn time flies!*
