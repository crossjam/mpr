Title: A New CPU

I subscribe to a lot of podcast feeds, but don’t listen to that
many. And I’m definitely pretty selective about which ones I support
financially. 

One of those is [Changelog++][2] and including support from very early
on in its existence. Adam and Jerod had a broad potpourri of feeds
covering a wide range of topics and the Changelog News newsletter is
entertaining. 

**Had**.

So it is with a raised eyebrow that I note the recent announcement
that Adam and Jerod are [shutting down their production of secondary
pods][1] such as Practical AI, Ship It!, Go Time, etc. Apparently all
of them will live on in some new form. Oddly, the core Changelog
podcasts have become less attractive (personality driven, big time
commitment), while the standout, must listen for me is Practical AI
(fortyish minutes typically, technical area of recent interest).

The announcement feels pretty transparent about the reasons why. Even
so I’m going to speculate on some of the drivers.

A significant factor is "pivoting to YouTube", which I’ve seen happen
on a few other podcasts I follow. Instead of pods being strictly
audio, and closer to radio, the core is a YouTube channel with the
audio episodes in RSS secondary. Yet another case of it’s where the
audience, attention, and money seems to be, to my chagrin.

Another aspect is that media production is a grind. Editing is time
consuming and not energizing from what I’ve heard from folks in the
trenches. I’m sure the Changelog team was running out of gas doing
production for others, on top of their shows, on top of their family
commitments. Adding to the dilemma are the effects of outsourced
production services and the incoming impact of AI on production.

Lastly, the ability to leverage network effects allows for some
separation without abandonment, a.k.a. the Changelog Podcast Universe

> CPU.fm (Changelog Podcast Universe) is our new home for spin-offs

Emphasis mine on _index_. I wouldn’t be surprised if that also meant
some whizbang podcast search, taking advantage of the Changelog archives,
with a heavy slather of AI all over.

Obviously as a paying customer I’ll be interested to see how things
work out and if Changelog++ patrons get any kind of enticement for
continuing support. Personally, I’m not really interested in dishing
out strictly for core Changelog content, especially if all the upside
is on YouTube, but we’ll see. In any event, I wish the guys the best.
