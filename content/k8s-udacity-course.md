K8S stands for [Kubernetes][1], which is a container orchestration platform from Google. Translation? Kubernetes is a system for running distributed code with high availability at scale. Looks like there’s [a nice bitesized Udacity course on Kubernetes][2] serving as an introduction.

> This course is designed to teach you about managing application containers, using Kubernetes. We've built this course in partnership with experts such as Kelsey Hightower and Carter Morgan from Google and Netflix’s former Cloud Architect, Adrian Cockcroft (current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures), who provide critical learning throughout the course.

> Mastering highly resilient and scalable infrastructure management is very important, because the modern expectation is that your favorite sites will be up 24/7, and that they will roll out new features frequently and without disruption of the service. Achieving this requires tools that allow you to ensure speed of development, infrastructure stability and ability to scale. Students with backgrounds in Operations or Development who are interested in managing container based infrastructure with Kubernetes are recommended to enroll!

Might have to carve out some time for this one.
