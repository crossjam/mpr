I enjoyed reading Ned Batchelder’s presentation on [idiomatic iteration in Python][1], even though I knew of everything he presented. Made me feel like I actually knew something about Python! It’s good baseline knowledge any Pythonista should comprehend and internalize.

He also ingeniously made it available in multiple formats.
