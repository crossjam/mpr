[Previously][1], UC Berkeley’s [Shark][2] had been giving me build fits. Finally tamed the savage beast. Had to resort to `java -verbose:class` to figure out where various classes and jars were coming from. Then a little surgery to put the appropriate Hadoop jars in the proper place and voilà, I can run the Shark examples against an hdfs repository.

With that out of the way, I’m now getting sucked into [Apache Hive][3] development. Yum, data crunching for fun and profit. I didn’t read too closely but I like what I perused of [*Programming Hive*][4] by Dean Wampler. Feels comprehensive and up to date.
