I sort of already knew of Pete Warden’s [Data Science Toolkit][2], but Ajay Ohri gives [a nice overview][1] of what’s actually inside:

> The Data Science Toolkit is a collection of the best open data sets and open-source tools for data science, wrapped in an easy-to-use REST/JSON API with command line, Python and Javascript interfaces. Available as a self-contained Vagrant VM or EC2 AMI that you can deploy yourself.

> The Data Science Toolkit is  essentially a specialized Linux distribution, with a lot of useful data software pre-installed and exposing a simple interface. Developer documentation is quite nicely done.
