> Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well
> on large sites, while using as little of your users’ bandwidth as
> possible, and without hosting any infrastructure. 

> Pagefind runs after Hugo, Eleventy, Jekyll, Next, Astro, SvelteKit,
> or any other SSG. The installation process is always the same:
> Pagefind only requires a folder containing the built static files of
> your website, so in most cases no configuration is needed to get
> started. 

Might be the search solution this site has been looking for.
