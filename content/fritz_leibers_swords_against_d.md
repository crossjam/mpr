The most intriguing thing about this set of tales is the varied publishing years. The earliest, and first ever Fafhrd and Mouser piece, *The Jewels in the Forest* appeared in 1939. *The Price of Pain-Ease* and *The Circle Curse* were released in 1970.

This disparity in ages leads to some distinctly different storytelling and writing styles. As always, Leiber brings a quite pleasurable sophistication to basic heroic swords and sorcery. Of the bunch, *The Howling Tower*, *Thieves House*, *Claws from the Night*, and *The Price of Pain-Ease* are my favorites. *The Howling Tower* is quite dark and disturbing, tending towards horror. *The Price of Pain-Ease* humorously solidifies the bonds between Fafhard and the Mouser with Sheelba of the Eyeless Face, and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes.

*Swords Against Death* isn't fabulous, but it is a notch above [*Elric of Melnibone* ][2] and a refreshing tonic relative to [Conan the Barbarian][3].

*7th book of the year down.*
