I haven’t extolled it too much here, but [I’m a fan][2] of what [marimo][1]
has been doing in the computational notebook space. As a small,
venture backed, startup it was relatively safe to root for them. Of
course venture backed implies a certain space of outcomes and one of
them came to pass. [Marimo joined CoreWeave][3].

I’m hopeful that this won’t severely impact marimo for at least two to
three years. There’s a fair bit of underlying robustness and stability
that could be added amongst the strong drive on features. Given
similar acquisitions I’ve seen, beyond that timescale is a
crapshoot. Blitzscaling startups or existing Big Tech organizations
purposefully make acquisitions fundamentally different as they become
further integrated. It’s sort of the point.

Of course some folks will be bent out of shape and declare "back to
Jupyter!!" That’s reasonable, except from what I understand you can’t
get to marimo from Jupyter.
