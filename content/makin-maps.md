> This is part one of a five-part series about our recent explorations making choropleth maps using PostGIS, TileMill, Mapnik and Google Maps.

Turns out to be total of six posts, but it’s still a handy, not too deep, [dive into making maps][1]. Forewarned, there’s a fair bit of command line tweakage and assumed familiarity with open source tech. *(Python Inside!)* Not for those used to a lot of desktop app handholding.
