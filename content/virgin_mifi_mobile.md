Glenn Fleishman [drills into the details][1] of Virgin Mobile's MiFi based pre-paid [mobile broadband service][2]. He compares and contrasts with Apple's current 3G products, AT&T data service for the iPhone and iPad, but it provides a useful framework to consider Virgin Mobile's utility.

While there is a premium on the cost per byte due to not having a contract, the delta isn't outrageous. As one commenter points out, on a contract you're in for $720 a year, whereas you may be able to more reasonably meter yourself with Virgin Mobile.

The only other downside appears to be, as another commenter points out, the relative lack of convenience of the MiFi vice the instant connectivity of the iPad or iPhone.
