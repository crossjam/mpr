> Milvus is an open-source vector database purpose-built to index,
> store, and query embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks
> and other machine learning (ML) models at billions of scales. It has
> become a popular choice for many companies, researchers, and
> developers who must perform similarity searches on large-scale
> datasets.

> contributors in the Milvus community, built Milvus Lite, a
> lightweight version of Milvus.
