From the front page, a couple of features leap out as being particularly useful:

* E-mail archiving and search using the mbox format

* The ability to annotate files with EagleFilter tags and notes

* Live search that's faster than Spotlight

* Thoughtful integration of AppleScript

Google Desktop Search has never really clicked for me on the Mac. Coming from a Mac centric developer, [C-Command Software][3], maybe EagleFiler will be a better fit.
