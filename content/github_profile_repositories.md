Title: GitHub Profile README.md
Status: published

[Simon Willison noted][1] that GitHub sneakily released a new feature that
seems to have some interesting potential:

>  GitHub quietly released a new feature at some point in the past few
>  days: profile READMEs. Create a repository with the same name as
>  your GitHub account (in my case that’s github.com/simonw/simonw),
>  add a README.md to it and GitHub will render the contents at the
>  top of your personal profile page—for me that’s github.com/simonw

Don’t know that I’ll push the self-updating limits that Simon is, but
I might use it to add some additonal static text to my profile page.
