Link parkin’, just because they’re so beautiful, [_zsa cards_][1]

The tagline is "A deck of inspiration and connection." I’ve bought
both the Original and Premium versions and have a deck within easy
reach right on my desk. When I get stuck in a monotonous monthly
status update Zoom call that doesn’t really need my participation, I
just flip through and admire the cards, letting my mind wander.

As advertised, they are quite attractive, entrancing objects. Highly
recommended.
