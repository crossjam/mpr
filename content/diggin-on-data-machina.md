Really been enjoying [the weekly Data Machina e-mail newsletter][1] put out by [@ds_ldn][4] a.k.a. Data Science London. It’s actually fairly dense, but usefully eclectic, focused on things relevant to “data science”, broadly construed. I always find at least a handful of links that are out and out great.
