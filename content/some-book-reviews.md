… in areas of recent interest to me.

[John D. Cook on][1]: [*R in Action*][5] and [*The Art of R Programming*][2].
> *In short, The Art of R Programming is for programmers, R in Action is for data analysts, and most other R books I’ve seen are for statisticians. Of course a typical R user is to some extent a programmer, an analyst, and a statistician. But this comparison gives you some idea which book you might want to reach for depending on which hat you’re wearing at the moment.*

[Gaël Varoquaux on][3]: [*NumPy 1.5 Beginner's Guide*][4]
> *The book actually covers more than only numpy: it is a full introduction to numerical computing with Python.*
