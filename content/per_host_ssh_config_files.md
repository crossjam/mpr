I've been a long time [ssh][2] user, but not with much sophistication. Caught a nice little tip on Lifehacker about setting up [per host ssh config files][1]. The key thing for me was being able to customize each configuration, give it a name, and have ssh tab complete named configurations. I'll have to give this a try toot de suite.
