The new [English Premier League][1] campaign kicks off, two weeks from yesterday. It feels like Manchester City just got done pulling [victory from the jaws of defeat][2]. 

I’ll have to check the summer transfers and evaluate who will win my rooting interest for the season. Betting folks will note that wagering against my allegiance may be a good idea. Arsenal and Chelsea have already rued my attention. Can’t really fancy rooting for any Mancunians, other than the Big Four and the Spurs, who might realistically challenge for the title?
