I'm a hockey newbie, but even I know that the first game of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, between the Chicago Blackhawks and Philadelphia Flyers, was a brutal affair. Both starting goaltenders looked like sieves. Somehow the Hawks managed to wind up with one more goal, [winning 6-5][2], and taking a 1-0 game lead.

I hadn't been following the Hawks closely until the semis, but their 3rd and 4th lines are really good. Bolland is a beast. Meanwhile, I was impressed with the amount of good chances the Flyers were able to generate.

**P.S.** As much as I'm a Chicago fan, I think The Fratellis [*Chelsea Dagger*][1] is a pretty stupid goal/victory song. Frankly, all of Chicago's team and theme songs have pretty much sucked. *Go, Cubs, Go*? *Don't Stop Believing*? *Bear Down, Chicago Bears*? Yick!!

*Super Bowl Shuffle* excepted, but that's 20+ years old.
