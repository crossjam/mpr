[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Malcolm McLaren Cover.jpg" alt="Malcolm McLaren Cover.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="148" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][2] ...*go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside. ... Four buffalo gals go 'round the outside and do-si-do your partner!*

In the wake of [his passing][6], the [obituaries][1] rightly focus on Malcolm McLaren's work with the [Sex Pistols][3]. But I remember at my earliest infatuation with Hip-Hop, digging through the bins in a Boston record store (probably Tower or Newbury Records), and picking up [*Dya Like Scratchin*][2] on a whim, just because the jacket "looked" Hip-Hop.

The little mini-album was a trove of early rappin', cuttin', and scratchin'. *Buffalo Gals* is an iconic piece of early Hip-Hop, but I'll always have a soft spot for *World's Famous* (and A Tribe Called Quest's homage [*Award Tour*][4]). Malcolm McLaren might have been the first white rapper to take the form seriously and actually pull it off.

McLaren wasn't a giant of Hip-Hop, but his small slice was [a seminal contribution][5]. Godspeed kind sir.
