In the murky depths of my DJ hind brain, I remembered Pal Joey as being somewhat legendary, but the big hits didn't leap immediately to mind.

Finally got around to looking up [Pal Joey on discogs.com][1] and man does he have a pretty impressive discography. Soho's [*Hot Music*][4] is probably the most legendary track *(I've got [the Outer Rhythm version][5] parked in storage)*, but there's a host of other significant original, production, and remix efforts across all forms of dance music.

Didn't know he'd gotten his introduction to the scene working at New York's legendary [Vinylmania][7] record shop.

Didn't know he'd worked with KRS-ONE on *Love's Gonna Get'Cha*.

Didn't know he'd remixed Deee-Lite's *How Do You Say…Love*.

Didn't know he'd remixed The Orb's *Little Fluffy Clouds*.

Didn't know he'd remixed Sade's *Cherish the Day*.

Didn't know the Earth People tracks *Dance* and *Reach Up to Mars* were some of his earliest cuts. Need to dig in to my archives and see if I have these collector's items.

And according to [the Pal Joey Music discography][6] he's still going strong.
