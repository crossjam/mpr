Link parkin’: [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge][1]

> The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge consists of a dataset
> and evaluation to enable research in music recommendations. It is a
> continuation of the RecSys Challenge 2018, which ran from January to
> July 2018. The dataset contains 1,000,000 playlists, including
> playlist titles and track titles, created by users on the Spotify
> platform between January 2010 and October 2017. The evaluation task
> is automatic playlist continuation: given a seed playlist title
> and/or initial set of tracks in a playlist, to predict the
> subsequent tracks in that playlist. This is an open-ended challenge
> intended to encourage research in music recommendations, and no
> prizes will be awarded (other than bragging rights).

Mmmmm... data. Unfortunately, terms of service limit usage to
participation in the challenge contest. So no data munging and
redistributing.
