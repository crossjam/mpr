[*Machine Learning for Hackers*][3] vs [*Machine Learning in Action*][2] to be precise. Two books. One topic. Different languages. [John D. Cook compares and contrasts][1]:
> *Both books are about the same size and many of the same topics. One difference between the two books is choice of programming language: ML for Hackers uses R for its examples, ML in Action uses Python.*

I was somewhat interested in *ML for Hackers* since I’m familiar with and admire [Drew Conway’s online writings][4]. The use of Python better aligns *ML in Action* with my interests though.
