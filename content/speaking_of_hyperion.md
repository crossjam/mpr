<a href="http://io9.com/">io9</a> reports that <a href="http://io9.com/5142952/hyperion-to-stand-still-for-new-director">development of a movie version of Hyperion</a> is proceeding apace with a directorial assignment. Unfortunately, it seems they're squishing <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553283685">Hyperion</a></i> and <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553288202">The Fall of Hyperion</a></i> into one movie. Not a good sign.

Color me skeptical.
