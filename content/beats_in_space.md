Speaking of [Beats In Space][1], this is a trove of mix history that I
need to dive into:

> Beats In Space is a radio show that started in 1999 on WNYU 89.1FM
> in New York City and is now broadcasting every week on Apple Music. 

> Beats In Space is brought to you by New York [DJ Tim Sweeney][6].

Not only does Sweeney have a guest mix, often he also does a mix,
**and** an [interview][2] with the guest dj:

> I’m excited to share that all Beats In Space interviews are now
> available for FREE on Apple Podcasts! Whether you’re a long-time

Great [backgrounder at the fifteen year mark][3] on Sweeney and the
show. Now currently at twenty five plus years and counting 😮, with a
only a single hiatus!

Previously I have spoken about the notion of [a _retrocast_][5] for spoken
word podcasts, but the same could be done for music podcasts / mix
series, tracing their evolution over time. I [chatted up Gemini][4]
about this during some background research on Carlita and asked "Are
there any such tools that look at longitudinal track trends, DJ
relations and history, and/or track genealogy". There’s a whole bunch
more to the thread but this kicks off **a lot of intellectual
provocation**.

Mixes, episodes, data integration and AI 🤔. Feels like a great rabbit
hole to get stuck into.
