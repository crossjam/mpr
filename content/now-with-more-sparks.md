> In an earlier post I listed a few reasons why I've come to embrace and use Spark. In particular I described why Spark is well-suited for many distributed Big Data Analytics tasks such as iterative computations and interactive queries, where it outperforms Hadoop. With version 0.6, Spark becomes even faster and easier to use. The release notes contain all the detailed changes, but as you'll see from the highlights below, version 0.6 is a substantial release. Another good sign is the growth in number of contributors, with now over a third of the developers coming from outside the core team in Berkeley.
