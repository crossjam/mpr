Probably the top track of the mix, highly memorable.

I'd like to think it was some serendipitous hand of a deity that made me dial up Scott Hardkiss' [*United DJ's of America, v17*][1] entry this week, but it was probably just randomness. I hadn't listened to this mix in over a year according to iTunes. The only reason I carry it on my iPhone is that I'm a completist for the *United DJ's* series. Imagine my surprise when *Shake It For Me* hits the headphones.

But I was even more surprised at how solid end-to-end the entire mix is. Discogs.com classifies the CD style as: "progressive house, house, disco," and it's damn hard to pigeonhole. *Shake It For Me* isn't even the best track, transcended for me by **Static Revenger's** *Happy People*, the whacky *Disco Rockin'* by **Plastic vs Conga Squad**, **C-Mos's** *6-2 Young*, **Boozy + Swan's** *Don't Touch That*, and **Armand Van Helden's** *Full Moon* featuring a guest appearance by [Common][4]. 

*Shake It For Me* definitely kicks off a great run off tracks, and I'm glad that I rediscovered this treasure. Definitely in the rotation for the near future.
