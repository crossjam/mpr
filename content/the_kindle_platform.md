This past Saturday, I hopped on the Metro to meet my Dad for the Wizards vs Celtics basketball game *([Wiz Win! Wiz Win!][3] Go home Massholes! Clap, clap, clapclapclap)*. There's a pretty long ride from Northern VA into downtown DC. Traveling light, I didn't bring the Kindle, but I was lamenting it's absence.

The lightbulb finally went off. I realized that I had my iPhone 4, with the Kindle App installed. Synced my farthest location in Rudy Rucker's [*Software*][4] and finished it up before I reached the Verizon Center.

And [Calibre][6] definitely makes it easy to get free books onto the Kindle, not to mention [Amazon's built-in e-mail transfer service][5].

Although they really need to let users customize the standby images displayed when the device is "off". Or at least let you set it to blank. I can only take so many literary giants.
