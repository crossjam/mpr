There have been upsets in the NCAA Men's Tournament before, but nothing like [Lehigh (15) beating Duke (2)][1].

Two observations. First, Lehigh outplayed Duke in both halves of the game. Duke was a bit lucky in getting a first half lead.

Second, Lehigh looked as good as, if not better, than any ACC team that has played Duke this year *(besides North Carolina who basically pwned the Blue Devils twice)*. Lehigh's defense was eminently capable of guarding Duke for extended periods of time and Duke never looked to have any sort of physical advantage. I mean C. J. McCollum got 'em for 30 points! Used to be a time when only folks at UNC, Maryland, UNLV, Michigan, Kentucky, et. al. could do that.

The margin between the rest of the country and the just-below-top tier of the big conferences is non-existent.
