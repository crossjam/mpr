Yeah, I knew he was a top-N villain from [*It’s A Wonderful Life*][1] but jeez, Potter knew Uncle Billy lost that money, knew George Bailey was covering for him, and still had to kick poor George while he was down. Jerk!

Greatest Christmas movie ever. If you haven’t had a shitty day like George Bailey, you’re not human. And hopefully you made it over the hump.

**Cheers!!**
