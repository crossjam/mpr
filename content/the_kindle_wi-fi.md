[Amazon's latest Kindle][1], at $139 for the Wi-Fi only edition, is a pretty tempting gadget.

There's plenty of recaps kicking around the 'net, but I liked [Engadget's quick reactions][2]. Here's the highlights:

* Cheaper

* Faster page turning

* Lighter

* Longer battery life

* More storage

The highly useful [comments on Hacker News][3] also break down the tradeoffs between the Kindle and other e-book devices/approaches at an OCD level. Of course the device really is dedicated to reading and targeted at folk who read, particularly books, a lot.

Can you say "Moore's Law in effect"? The thing is now pretty doggone close to an impulse purchase for mere mortals. Kindle pricing has moved down into game console cost territory. And the programming is a bit cheaper.

I'm not down on my iPod Touch, but I'm trending towards becoming a computer sherpa *(term courtesy [Ken Forbus][4])*. I'll probably have an app phone by the end of the year along with some kind of pad or e-reader. A phalanx of the Touch, an Android phone, and a Kindle would make a nice combination.

*Hey Lee, let me know what you think of the new Kindles!*
