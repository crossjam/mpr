Well at least one other person with credibility, [Jesper][3] of [Waffle Software](http://wafflesoftware.net/), seems to think Apple might be in *(getting into?)* a position to sanction a new development language. Jesper calls it "xlang" and thinks it's meant to [surpass Objective-C][1]. But not [replace][2] it. Good comments as well on Jesper's *Surpass* post.

Jibes a bit with [my theoretical out gambit][4] for Apple and Section 3.3.1. Especially since Apple sponsors and contributes personnel time to [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/) and heavily uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org).

And I had forgotten John Siracusa's [in-depth projection of the future of Mac OS][5], including a heavy dose of what could happen to Objective-C.
