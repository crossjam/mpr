I don't follow too many linkblogs these days, but [Nelson Minar established a Pinboard account to capture his URLs of note][1]. He claims it's better than [his blog](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/). Don't know if that's true but in NetNewsWire I've been flagging a lot of links he's been pointing too. Plenty of good, solid, diverse hacking content. Time to give the stream a little publicity.
