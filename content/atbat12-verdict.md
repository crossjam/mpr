Previously, I had put Major League Baseball’s [AtBat 2012][2] on a probationary test drive for one month. The result?

AtBat 2012 is so useful to me, that I waited until my subscription expired so I could make a full $9.99 in-app full season purchase. I probably could have made it with another $2.99 monthly renewal or two. However, I wanted to fork over a few extra shekels as admiration for something that truly delights me. 

The streaming is top-notch and I easily put on one to two games a night. Typically 'Nats and then a West Coast game. On the iPad the scoreboard is beautiful and comprehensive. Full details of any of the day’s games are within a tap or two. The real-time Gameday displays are neat if a bit of out of synch with the streamed audio. 

And I haven’t even taken advantage of any of the video features. Bravo MLB!
