I’m probably going to spring for [MacWhisper Pro][1]

It got [solid marks from Simon Willison][2]. Vincent Warmerdam is only
using the free version, but he’s got [MacWhisper wired up to a
programmatic keyboard][3]. Both gentlemen have good taste in my eyes.

Initially I’d use it like Warmerdam for agentic coding. If it can be
CLI automated it could become an essential part of the [retrocast][4]
pipeline.
