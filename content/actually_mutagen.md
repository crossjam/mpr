Actually, [mutagen][1] is probably the right tool for the MP4 metadata
job at hand, especially with the [`EasyMP4`][2] class available

> Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports
> ASF, FLAC, MP4, Monkey’s Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC,
> Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG,
> and AIFF audio files. All versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all
> standard ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read Xing headers to
> accurately calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2
> tags can be edited regardless of audio format. It can also
> manipulate Ogg streams on an individual packet/page level.
