* [*Bayesian statistics made (as) simple (as possible)*][2]
* [*Data analysis in Python with pandas*][3]
* [*Social Network Analysis with Python*][4]
* [*Making Interactive Maps for the Web*][5]

I would have preferred Raymond Hettinger's [*Advanced Python 1*][6] instead of *Social Network Analysis*, just to break up the data intensive run, but it was sold out. Maybe sometime in the future.

That's gonna make for a pretty packed and intense schedule when you factor in the talks on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Not to mention I'm essentially taking red-eye flights on each end. But the goal is to mainline the Python experience and come back firing on all hacking cylinders. We'll see if I survive.
