There's also a short blog entry for each of these books this month. Not exactly a review but a quick hit instant reaction.

* [*Oryx and Crake*][1], Margaret Atwood. A scathing satire of humanity's inhumanity, our relationship with nature, and the hubris of bioengineering. Both disturbing and hilarious, the novel is also cleverly plays with language.

* [*This Is Not A Game*][2], Walter Jon Williams. Just a good solid thriller or piece of near-time speculative fiction depending upon your perspective. Not a classic in my book, but good old science fiction comfort food.

* [*Thirteen*][3], Richard K. Morgan. Another alpha male mystery/odyssey from Morgan. Has some interesting themes, but also has a tough time standing up to the Takeshi Kovacs series.

* [*The Godfather*][4], Mario Puzo. If you're **really** into the movie version, then *The Godfather* is worth reading for some missing backstory. Otherwise, spend your time elsewhere.

After last month's reading slowdown, I got reinvigorated and read more consistently. Four more down, makes for 30 completed on the year. Five more to complete [the target reading goal][5] for the year. Well within range.
