Wow was that a great read! Simultaneously disturbing in the highly possible inhumanity and hubris on display yet delightful in the language play and satire. *Oryx and Crake* was one of the few books I've read recently that had laugh out loud moments.

If for nothing else, the book is worth reading for Atwood's carefully crafted and targeted neologisms and corporate names. HealthWyzer. Pigoons. AnooYoo. Rakunks. CorpSeCorps. Wolvogs. Independent of their cuteness, in the context of the novel, they serve to thoroughly skewer our own current condition. I'll never be able to think of Chicken Nuggets as anything other than Chicken Nobbies from here on out.
