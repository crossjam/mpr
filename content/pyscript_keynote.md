Peter Wang gave [a keynote][1] at PyCon US 2022. Apparently it excited
a lot of people. The topic was [PyScript][5], a project to put Python in
the browser via [WebAssembly][6].

> PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python
> applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of
> Pyodide, WASM, and modern web technologies. The PyScript framework
> provides users at every experience level with access to an
> expressive, easy-to-learn programming language with countless
> applications.

Here’s a recording of Peter’s keynote:

Tobias Macey released [a PyScript focused podcast episode][3] of _The Python
Podcast \_\_Init\_\__ with Russell Keith-Magee going deep into the
overall strategy and the technical details.

Meanwhile, Michael Kennedy [interviewed Fabio Pliger][4], the key
developer of PyScript, on _Talk Python to Me_.

Plenty of material for a motivated developer to make decisions on the
reality of PyScript. On the one hand, it’s alpha and there have been
any number of similarly styled attempts over the past few years. On
the other, maybe the base technologies have matured enough that in
combination with Anaconda corporate support a robust project,
community, and ecosystem can emerge. Anaconda was there for the Python
data/numerical computing community so lightning could strike twice.
