I've been enjoying [Philip Greenspun's oeuvre][2] since way back when he was writing about AOLServer, Tcl, and database backed websites. I even [bought the book][3]!

Plus, he's got [a rapier wit][4] on the order of Olin Shivers. So herewith the conclusion to his [entertaining review][1] of the BlackBerry Playbook:


> *Not useful as a computer; too light to serve as a doorstop.*

> *My friend has not asked for the tablet back (he got it for free at a conference).*

Touche!
