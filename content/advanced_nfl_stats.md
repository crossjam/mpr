Found a new data driven, football site: [*Advanced NFL Stats*][1]

I've briefly examined the state of open football stats in the past and found them wanting. Now it looks like things are picking up with [*Pro-Football-Reference.Com*][3]. However, it looks like they've gone to [buying their data from ESPN][4], which means no further distribution.

So much for open data.
