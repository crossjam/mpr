After watching bits of a few games during opening week, here are a few observations:

* The Wizards are still a bunch of piece parts, and I’m not sure John Wall will make all that much difference. At least they’re a bit more professional and likable than last year.
* Based upon how close they played the San Antonio Spurs, the New Orleans Hornets might be quite surprising this year. They’ve got four rookies, Anthony Davis, Al-Farouq Aminu, Austin Rivers, and Darius Miller, that look like they can play. Then there’s a core of good, e.g. <del>Brian</del> Ryan Anderson *(Go Bears!)* but not great veterans as support. Wouldn’t be surprised to see them challenge for the last playoff spot in the West.
* The Los Angeles Clippers, yes Clippers, have a hell of a bench.
* James Harden may go off for a while as the #1 guy for the Houston Rockets, but then the Association will get a book on him. Let’s see what happens then.
* The Knicks are still stuck in neutral, and somehow they feel even older than last year.
* Can’t wait for DRose to get back:
