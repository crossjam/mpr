[Posterous](http://posterous.com) is doing some serious rapid innovation, especially in their [autoposting][1] capability. Exploiting the syntactic capabilities of standard RFC 822 e-mail addresses they're building up a fairly sophisticated, yet accessible, infrastructure to flow content into social media sites.

The only nit I have is the last line of their autopost FAQ:

> *We do not autopost private posts, or posts created on private sites.*

As I wanted to experiment with autoposting I was trying to send test stuff to my Twitter account. Since I'm just doinking around with posterous, my site was private. So here I am wondering where the heck the first twitter updates I'd sent in over a year were. Silly me.

One side benefit of using e-mail as a posting front end is that in many e-mail systems you can easily capture all of your outbound messages. Instant blog post backups!! Mitigates some of the [backup issues I mentioned earlier][2].

Now I'm leaning even more towards experimenting with posterous, especially as a progress/development blog on my eventual [100 hour project][3].
