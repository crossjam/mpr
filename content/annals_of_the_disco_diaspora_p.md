But four years of college in Boston, starting in 1985, gave me a front row seat for the genre's breakout into the underground. The transmission vector was a cohort of New York students, a few of whom had pretentions to deejaying. They obviously brought a lot of fresh Hip-Hop back to campus, but they also mixed in this new higher tempo stuff from Chicago.

Thinking back to those days, and my own delusions of spinning records, I remembered a handful of tracks that were often played at campus events or late night on the college radio mix shows. I eventually got all of these records on vinyl, but by chance looked to see if there were MP3 versions for sale. I wasn't holding out much hope, but was pleasantly surprised to find the following:

* **Serious Intention**, [*You Don't Know*][1], Easy Street Records 1984. A little slower than the typical House track, but the synth lines are to die for. The swirling breakdown is legendary.

* **Cultural Vibe**, [*Ma Foom Bey*][2], Easy Street Records 1986. Similar to *You Don't Know*, *Ma Foom Bey* has great synth lines. The chunky organ sound is the hallmark of this track. Also, probably one of the earliest tracks to incorporate African chanting.

* **Nitro Deluxe**, [*Let's Get Brutal*][3], Cutting Records 1986. If Phuture's [*Acid Tracks*][6] is the first Acid House record, then 1986's *Let's Get Brutal* is definitely a precursor. The ultra-minimalist 14 minute version, *The Brutal House*, is sans Roland TB-303 tweakiness, but definitely comes from the same spare, trancy mentality.

* **Strafe**, [*Set It Off*][4], Jus Born Records 1984. This is a little more up tempo and arguably more Electro than House. But I note it here for the emphasized head-cutting hi-hat. Hey, if Walter Gibbons mixed it and Larry Levan threw it down on the decks, that's close enough for me.

I found the first three on the Amazon MP3 music store. Apparently, a lot of the [Easy Street Records][7] catalog recently came available. *Set It Off* I found on the iTunes Music Store.

Best of all, these four tracks date pretty well. I think House DJ of today worth their salt wouldn't be embarrassed to throw any of these tracks into the mix right now. Might even be a badge of honor.
