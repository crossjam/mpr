A nice side effect of installing the Amazon Kindle app on my iPad is that I was reminded of a number of e-books that I had bought. There was a total of nine, seven of which I hadn't even started, plus two barely begun. Good works including [*Ready Player One*][1], [*The Restoration Game*][2], and [*You Are Not So Smart*][3]. Now I don’t have to spend a bunch of bucks on summer reading material.

I also went back and revisited a bunch of book I had bought from O’Reilly and uploaded as PDFs. O’Reilly also supports Amazon’s `.mobi` format and they let you redownload if needed. Gotta say that while PDFs look really nice, `.mobi` books shine in a big way. Good on O’Reilly for quality support as well.
