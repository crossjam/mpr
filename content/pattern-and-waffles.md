Link parkin: [waffles][1], because I'm now in love with both [CLIs][3] and [ML][4].
> *Waffles seeks to be the world's most comprehensive collection of command-line tools for machine learning and data mining. Our native tools have minimal dependencies (no interpreter, VM, or runtime environment is necessary), and build cross-platform. If you have a useful data mining tool that meets these criteria, we want it in Waffles.*

[pattern][2], because I'm still in love with Python, ML, and information visualization.
> *Pattern is a web mining module for the Python programming language.
It bundles tools for data retrieval (Google + Twitter + Wikipedia API, web spider, HTML DOM parser), text analysis (rule-based shallow parser, WordNet interface, syntactical + semantical n-gram search algorithm, tf-idf + cosine similarity + LSA metrics) and data visualization (graph networks).*
