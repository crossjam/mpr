The [list of PyCon 2013 talks][2] was [announced][1]:
> As you may already know, this was an incredibly hard decision for the Program Commitee: we had over 450 submissions for only 114 slots on the program. Further, the quality of submissions was very high; the committee debated each and every talk very closely. I want to sincerely thank everyone who submitted a talk: the quality of PyCon comes from our speakers, and this year you all blew it out of the water.

Sounds like the potential for a great program. Unfortunately, I can’t be as [excited][3] as I was last year since I’m not as confident that I can get away. Still,  I’m quite interested in the more hardcore groupings like “Big Data” *(yeah I know buzzword compliant)* and even more so in the tutorials lineup.
