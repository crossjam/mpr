As a [*very* early del.icio.us fanboy][2], and current [Pinboard][3] customer, [Maciej Ceglowski’s chutzpah][1] impresses me.

> Pinboard has acquired Delicious. Here’s what you need to know:

> If you’re a Pinboard user, nothing will change. Sad!

> If you’re a Delicious user, you will have to find another place to save your bookmarks. The site will stay online. but on June 15, I will put Delicious into read-only mode. You won't be able to save new bookmarks after that date, or use the API.

Not sure if I’m more surprised that del.icio.us is still live or that it went for so cheap.
