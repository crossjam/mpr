The one issue with going bigger and better with my Tweet collection is the actual storage, especially if I want to continuously run a spatial DB, like PostGIS. I was just poking around on the Intarwebs and the pricing seems prohibitive for a beginner spatial hacker with significant data.

[CartoDB](http://CartoDB.com)  can get you started for $29 a month, but you only have a piddly 50Mb of storage.

According to Heroku, PostGIS is available as [an extension to their hosted Postgres product][3]. This includes a whopping 1 Tb of storage. However, the smallest package is [$200 a month][2]!

Man, I didn’t know hosting PostGIS was so difficult.
