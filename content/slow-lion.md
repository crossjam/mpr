My trusty MacBook is feeling a bit pokey for the first time ever. I may have reached the limits of its resources what with a bazillion tabs open in Chrome, a few in Firefox, and a handful of other apps running. Plus, I'm using Spaces. 

Maybe some tab clearance will help out, but whenever the next edition of MacBooks or MacBook Airs come out, I will seriously be lusting.
