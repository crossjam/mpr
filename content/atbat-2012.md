In an effort to cut way back on the Couch Potato action, I’m trying for more listening than watching. The iPad makes for a good music media player, but sports programming is the critical factor. I can cut back on the sports “news” and mindless chatter through self-discipline, but live games are my Kryptonite. At least when I’m listening to a live broadcast I can multitask on things like writing code. TV just pins me slug like on the couch.

So I’m giving [MLB AtBat 12][1] a run *(even as I post this!)* as it allows you to listen to every Major League Baseball radio broadcast as a digital stream. Pair it with some Bluetooth speakers and you’ve got a modern day Rube Goldberg radio, complete with Retina Display!

So far the experience has been great, and the price right at $2.99 for my trial month. While, MLB seems to have their act together, we’ll see how things fare during football, football, basketball, and hockey seasons. My impression is that the NFL, NCAA, EPL, NBA, and, NHL aren’t quite at the same level of sophistication. But at least I can build up the the anti-TV habit.
