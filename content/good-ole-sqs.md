Jeff Barr writes regarding some [new additions to SQS][1]:
> We announced the Simple Queue Service (SQS) eight years ago, give or take a day. Although this was our first infrastructure web service, we launched it with little fanfare and gave no hint that this was just the first of many such services on the drawing board. I'm sure that some people looked at it and said "Huh, that's odd. Why is my online retailer trying to sell me a message queuing service?" Given that we are, as Jeff Bezos has said, "willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time," we didn't see the need to say any more.

Eight years?! Why it seems just like yesterday that I was being [somewhat prescient and errr, overly effusive][2] about Amazon’s first bit of Infrastructure as a Service.
