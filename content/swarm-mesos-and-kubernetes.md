The [podcast episodes from The New Stack][2] tend to be hit or miss for me. There’s quite a bit of information-free content but every now and then you get a good nugget or two.

Such was [a recent edition of The New Stack Analysts][3] just after Docker announced support for Kubernetes as an orchestration engine. Dell’s Josh Bernstein gave [his 10,000 foot view][1] of the production orchestration expertise in the Docker, Kubernetes, and Mesos communities. I’m paraphrasing *(you can listen for yourself)*, but it felt like elementary school (Docker), high school (Kubernetes), and masters (Mesos). 

> For those working with large-scale data services, Bernstein explained that Mesos is often the developer tool of choice for big data applications and those running the SMACK stack, emphasizing that Kubernetes simplistic nature has yet to address these issues.

Bernstein’s key point was that the Mesos community has been deploying big data driven production workloads for quite a while now. The elegance and energy of k8s may not be there, but there’s a battle-hardened experience that leads to much deeper technical depth in public presentations, at least as measured by conferences like Mesoscon. 

Feels about right. YMMV.
