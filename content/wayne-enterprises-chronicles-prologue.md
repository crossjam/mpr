This year’s fantasy football office league edition has been named [*Wayne Enterprises*][2] in honor of the conclusion of *The Dark Knight* trilogy.

Besides, it makes for a catchy logo.

After the break, my draft and some thoughts on the team’s potential.

8 team league. Snake draft with random position assignments. Overall draft position in parens. I lucked into the number 1 pick for the 2nd time in three *(four?)* years. And of course, this is a year I do no preparation. The last time I drew first overall though ended in tears, with [CJ2K not doing very well][4], and dragging my team down with him.

1.	(1)	Arian Foster	RB
2.	(16)	Cam Newton	QB
3.	(17)	Darren McFadden	RB
4.	(32)	Marques Colston	WR
5.	(33)	Hakeem Nicks	WR
6.	(48)	Miles Austin	WR
7.	(49)	Jason Witten	TE
8.	(64)	Steven Jackson	RB
9.	(65)	Tony Romo	QB
10.	(80)	Baltimore	DEF
11.	(81)	Dwayne Bowe	WR
12.	(96)	Robbie Gould	K

I might have gone a little early with Cam Newton, but given I could get two top RBs in my first three picks, I thought he was worth the reach. My receivers are a boom or bust set. I expect two of the four to go down with injuries by week three. I had to dump Jason Witten already for Tony Gonzalez.

Relative to other teams in the league, I feel like I’m in pretty good shape. There’s one other, maybe two, teams that had similar quality drafts. Of course things will evolve rapidly as real games are played, but I’m looking forward to my chances this year.
