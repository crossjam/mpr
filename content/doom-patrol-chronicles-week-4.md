With the scoring rules in my league, he dropped 51 fantasy points, far and away the top scorer in the league. 

Which was pretty handy, seeing as how the opposing fantasy QB was [Cam Newton][2], who wasn't too shabby at 30 points himself. Plus my opponent also played Greg Jennings for 19 points, Ray Rice for 20, and Darren McFadden for 14. 

Besides Rodgers, the key support on my team came from WRs Santana Moss for 12 points, Julio Jones for 18, Fred Jackson for 18, and Jason Witten for 19. Between Rodgers and Witten, I cruised to an easy 26 point lead, although I had to wait out a potential Ray Rice explosion.

The league only has 8 teams in it, so there's plenty of talent to go around. The key is getting one or two really outstanding performances, which is a combination of matchups and luck. 

At this point I'm 2-2, fighting for the 4th playoff spot. Still plenty of games to go, but I have to put a little streak together. I think I've got a viable core, but I'm always scuffling on a spot or two. At least this week, I don't think anyone got injured. 

The NFL is heading into its stretch of bye weeks, which puts the bench and the waiver wire at a premium. I think I'm configured for success during these challenging weeks, but we'll see.

**Update**: Title modified for the correct team in 2011. Yeesh! I'm slipping.

**Update 2**: Oops! Forgot about Rashard Mendenhall pulling a hammy, and possibly missing next week. Then again, he was due for a benching anyway.
