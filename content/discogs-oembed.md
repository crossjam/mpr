Since I’ve been heavily using the WordPress embed feature for tweets, I had a though that it would be nice if you could do the same thing for referencing musical releases in [Discogs.com](http://discogs.com). But alas, they seem not to support [oEmbed][1].

However Discogs does seem to have a nice [client API][2], with a [supporting Python module][3] to boot. Seems like a Discogs oEmbed proxy server might be a nice self-contained hacking project.
