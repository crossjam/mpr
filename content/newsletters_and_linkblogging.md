Title: Newsletters and Linkblogging

I subscribe to a decent number of newsletters, like [Python Weekly][1],
that are basically curated collections of links. I want to do more
[linkblogging][4] and these are great resources but for the following
problems:

* There’s not an easy way to pry out and blockquote text for
  individual links
* The embedded links flow through tracking redirectors, so it’s hard
  to know the ultimate destination
* Linkpost creation needs an easy way to do some type of _via_
  attribution
  
Sounds like time to get on the hacking bandwagon. One potentially
useful hack is that I’m pushing a number of newsletters into a Feedbin
mail address and [reading them there][2]. I wonder what they look like
when grabbed out of the [Feedbin api][3]?
