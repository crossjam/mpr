I [know about][3] and use `virtualenv` for Python quite frequently. I've had an off and on relationship with `pip`, allegedly "... a replacement for the (outmoded) `easy_install` command." My main issue has been key packages that don't install over the network, requiring a fallback to `easy_install`. Adam Charnock has [a couple of `pip` tips][1] that might improve our arrangement. Also includes a link to a handy [guide on `pip` and packaging][2].
