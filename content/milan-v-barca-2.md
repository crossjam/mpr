DVRed the second leg of the AC Milan versus FC Barcelona UEFA Champions League quarterfinals match. Can’t say I was captivated but did see Messi's brilliance. That dude can accelerate **with the ball**, like nobody’s business.   Two PKs weren’t thrilling but at least Milan put in a little spice by scaring Barca with a leveling goal.

Like I said though, bet on Barca.
