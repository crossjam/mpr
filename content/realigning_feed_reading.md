Recently I noticed that I had an unruly sprawl of feeds across 3 different Google Reader accounts and NetNewsWire on my personal laptop. Time for some housekeeping.

I collapsed most of the feeds from the Google Reader accounts into one account. The few leftover are work related, so I just left them in a work-specific account. Meanwhile, the collapsed set I now read on my iPod Touch using NetNewsWire for that platform.

That pile of feeds covers a large portion of my broad technology, gadget, and culture interests dating back to my past life. It's a big part of my daily info fix. Reading them on the touch feels a lot more productive. I sit down for one session after work and flick through a big pile of the days items in about 30 minutes. Works better than the intermittent grazing I was doing during the day.

Now I need to make more usage of sending items to Evernote or e-mailing posts from NetNewsWire.
