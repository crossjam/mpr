The opponent yet again scored over 100 fantasy points against me. That makes 10 out of 11 weeks. I only really had one disappointing performer, Denarius Moore for 1.9 points. That was enough damage though, especially when facing two big scorers like Victor Cruz and Ray Rice. 

The injury bug strikes yet again. Fred Jackson goes down for the season with a broken leg. Criminy! I didn't even play the guy this past week. The Fantasy Gods are really out to get me.

Now I have to win out my last three games, and get a big dose of help against the fourth place team in my league. The Rangers will compete until the bitter end though!
