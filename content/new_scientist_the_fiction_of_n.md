This [review][1] of Greg Egan's [*Oceanic*][3], appearing on the [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/) website,  makes the book sound very tempting. Then again, I'm still recovering from the head explosion induced by [the last Egan book I read, *Diaspora*][2].

*Oceanic* is also a short story collection, which I'm disinclined to read. But I'm parking the link here as a note for future consideration.

The review appeared in a special issue of New Scientist, [*the fiction of now*][5] which has a cute little piece of [flash fiction from Ken MacLeod][4], amongst a lot other good nibbles.

*Retconned for typos.*
