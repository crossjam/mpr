So I [made my own fork][1] of [pelican][2] to just extract the raw content from a WordPress XML export. Initial indicators are pretty good. Using pelican’s built-in web serving capability, a small sampling of the derived posts seem to have come through completely intact and appear to do well with pelican’s transformation to HTML. 

Next up, exploration of [pelican theming][3] to eventually give this blog a fresh face.
