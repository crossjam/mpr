Forgive me Saint Steven for I have sinned. As a recently realized Apple fanboy I failed to tune in for today’s announcements. My employer sent me to occupy a lonely *(but very shiny!)* booth in the bowels of a second rate hotel with an exceedingly lackluster conference. But I should have found A Way!

The only in-depth coverage I have been able to read so far, is [Marco Arment’s assorted thoughts][1]. They have me  **stoked**:
> Prior to this, the computer I recommended for nearly everyone was the 13” MacBook Air. But the new 13” Retina MacBook Pro is only about 0.6 pounds heavier, has much higher CPU, RAM, and storage options, and has the much nicer Retina screen. It commands a premium of about $500, which is significant, but you get much more for it.

That’s pretty much the machine I’ve been fiending for for the longest time. I'll nitnoid about not being able to amp the DRAM to 16Gb, but that’s the only thing I could quibble about. However, between lack of funds, and dampened laptop usage due to life and other gear, now I may just hang on to Ye Olde MacBook indefinitely. Or at least there is clear provocation. 

But I’m simultaneously **chapped**
> The timing of the update — just 6 months after the iPad 3, instead of the usual year — will anger a lot of iPad 3 owners. But the previous March releases of the iPad 2 and 3 were more problematic.

You mean The New Toy is already not the new hotness? Ya killin’ me.

At least I have my new Jesusphone 5 to keep me warm at night.
