But he just got **+10**, as I found out Rapaport's directed a documentary on the hip-hop pioneers [A Tribe Called Quest][2]. Entitled [*Beats, Rhymes, & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest*][1], it apparently did well at Sundance and the Tribeca Film Festival.

For those of us who grew up on 80's to 90's hip-hop, [Tribe's oeuvre][3] is seminal at the same level as Public Enemy and KRS-One. Hope the documentary lives up to their contributions.

Looks like the film gets [a limited release][4] starting in July. This might be the only movie I see in the theater all year.

*Via [Unclouded by Ambition][6]. Bonus points if you know who played Floyd without hitting IMDb.*
