Title: Speaking of Overcast

Apropos the title, [Overcast went through a redesign][1], released a
few weeks ago. The day it came out I was literally thinking, "is there
a way in Overcast to find one’s started, but not completed, podcast
episodes?" Voilà! Feature delivered.

For a while I gave Apple Podcasts a run, but once on the [Overcast][2]
bandwagon, I’ve never looked back. Highly recommended, and well worth
paying the annual subscription to support the developer, [Marco
Arment][3].
