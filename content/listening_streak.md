Speaking of streaks, 1 year ago I set about to listen to more
music. The screen capture above, from the [Streaks iOS app][1] on my phone,
emphasizes that I’ve managed to do that for 365 days
straight. 🎊 🥳 🎉 Listening in this case means a minimum of 3 songs, but
almost uniformly I got in a full "CD" if not multiples.

What always gets me about these types of streaks is overcoming those
crappy days. Days when you fell wishy washy and think you might have
COVID. Days when work runs long and you feel dead tired. Days when
your kids get on your last nerve. Days when you feel like you let
everyone down.

But a little music always soothes the soul, even if one falls asleep
in the middle of the mix 🤣.
