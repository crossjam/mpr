Title: Personal Podscape Memex

The initial salvo on [the podcast deep dive thesis][1] was divorced
from end users, strictly based upon the content of the
podcast. Another aspect of interest to me is the incorporation of
personalization.

I listen to a small percentage of the episodes from feeds I’m
subscribed to. Each one I do listen to feels like there’s a ton of
knowledge, of which I retain just fragments. Could an intelligent
podcast app monitor my listening and automatically weave together
products that could help my future self? At the very least a
personalized search engine could be crafted. But is a [memex][2] for my
personal podscape in reach?

Overcast has an [OPML export feature][3], including a rich version
with episode data. A prototyping foundation seems apparent. [Jonathan
LaCour][4] cooked up [a Python script][5] to automate the download.
