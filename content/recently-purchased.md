* Evol Intent [*Us Against the World*][1]
* Counterstrike [*Back From the Grave*][2]
* Derrick Carter [*Fabric 56*][3]

The first two are straight up Drum 'N Bass DJ mix efforts. 70+ minutes of hardcore riddims and tweakin acid. There's no point looking at the track list. You just get on the train and ride the beat.

Derrick Carter's [Fabric][4] effort is straight up Chicago House, featuring tracks from venerable names such as DJ Sneak, Cajmere/Green Velvet, and Roger Sanchez. I was surprised how well Sanchez's *My Organ* held up, although I'll always remember it as part of Little Louie Vega's [*United DJ's of America*][5] mix from way back in '94.

At $10 a pop for the electronic download version of each, I can recommend them all, **if** you're into this style of music.

I've got to give a lot of credit to [Discogs.com](http://discogs.com) for now clearly highlighting DJ mixes. Makes my music hunting life a bit easier.
