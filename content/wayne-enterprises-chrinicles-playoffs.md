Appropriate on this final weekend of the NFL regular season that I document my collapse.

On the one hand, I got beat by a sizeable margin, 122.7 to 85.30. So it would appear my roster choices really wouldn’t have made a difference. On the other hand, consider this:

* I listened to the fantasy “experts” and at the last minute substituted the red hot Danario Alexander instead of my usual Eric Decker. Alexander goose egg, Decker 23 fantasy points, me as GM -23.
* On the same expert advice I played the St. Louis Rams DEF for a grand total of 1 point. I could have easily played one or two other units for 6-9 more points
* I stuck with Lawrence Tynes as my kicker, admittedly with no encouragement, for the only game where the Giants got shut out. That means Tynes got 0 points too.
* Arian Foster came up short of his projection by 8 points.
* I pooh poohed a roster move by my opponent benching Torrey Smith and playing Brandon Lloyd. +23 for him.
* The opposition survived a 0.1 performance from his QB position.

So as I float into the fantasy off-season,  I’ll console myself with the thought that my optimal lineup wouldn’t have won. But three self-inflicted zeros leaves a quite bitter taste. If I had added 30 points who knows what could have happened.
