Yesterday I busted my 434 day music listening streak, dangit! 😢

I hung my listening habit off of my exercise habit, but had a little
change up yesterday. Went for a walk in the morning instead of the
evening and rushed out the door to meet the daily schedule. Then
never got around to picking out a tracklist and firing it up. 

Ah well. [We go again][1].

_Said the Manchester City fan, heh._
