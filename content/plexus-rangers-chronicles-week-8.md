I go into the Sunday night game with over 85 points, a 7 point lead, and 2 players left: Miles Austin and Jason Witten. Going against the Eagles no less. Sure, my opponent had LeSean McCoy who I knew could bust out, but 2 prime players against 1 should be advantage Rangers.

Sadly, I would only go on to add 9 more points *(jeez I hate the Cowboys)* while McCoy hit for 33. The Plexus Rangers lost by 17 points. And just to rub the salt in my wounds, I didn't start the Rams' Steven Jackson. 33 points sitting on my bench.

We've had one go round through the league plus one. **Every** game I've had 100 points scored against me. Makes for a 3 and 5 record, 7th place in an 8 team league, and in bad playoff position. At least I'm only 2 games out in the loss column.
