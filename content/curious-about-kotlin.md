I’ve been meaning to link park [the Kotlin programming language][1]. In general, I’m just a programming language nerd and when Google promoted [Kotlin for official Android programming][3], the language hit my radar. Via some random Web surfing *(people still do that right?)* I came across this brief RedMonk overview of [why Kotlin is gaining in popularity][2]:

> The short version is that Kotlin is a JVM-based language originally released in 2011 by the JetBrains (makers of IntelliJ) team from St Petersburg, Russia. Like Scala, an inspiration for the language, Kotlin is intended to improve on the Java foundations both syntactically and otherwise while trading on that platform’s ubiquity.
