[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/DynDNS Logo.png" alt="DynDNS Logo.png" border="0" width="258" height="54" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][4] I have a little Linux box in my basement, which I occasionally login to remotely. Dynamic Network Services' [free dynamic DNS service][3] gives that machine a convenient domain name under `homeunix.net`.

Dynamic DNS has expanded its available domains since I originally signed up. You can even [get a hostname under `kicks-ass.net`][1]. Plus there's [a whole bunch more cool domains][2] for a small fee. Who knew?

Might have to get me a couple of those. Whaddya think of `crossjam.kicks-ass.net`?
