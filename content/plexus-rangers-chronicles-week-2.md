Picked the wrong kicker. Picked the wrong DEF. Stuck with Rashard Mendenhall against the Ravens. Then dumped Ahmad Bradshaw, with a decent matchup, thinking I might be able to make a late afternoon waiver move. Oops! All free agents hit the waiver wire at the start of Sunday, so nobody can make moves during the day. Know your league's rules son!

Week 2 was a much happier affair. I had some plush match ups, and actually made some good GM moves.

* Figured Miles Austin was going to have a big day against SF. Didn't know he was going to be the top WR for our league this week. 

* Made the brilliant move of picking up and starting Buffalo's Fred Jackson. Finished in the top 5 and only 0.8 points out of the top RB scoring position.

* Rob Bironas kicked his way back into form, and Houston's defense did a decent job against Miami.

* Stuck with regulars Aaron Rodgers, Jason Witten, Rashard Mendenhall, and Santana Moss. Everybody delivered double digit fantasy points, with Moss surprisingly totaling 14.

With everyone on my team scoring double digits, I've cruised to a 40+ point victory. The only downside is that Austin looks like he's going to be on the shelf for a few games. That's okay though, there's a couple of emerging WRs, with good matchups, I've got my eye on. Been working hard to make up for [my draft day bye blunders][2]. I'm feeling that waiver wire magic again, revamping my team week to week.
