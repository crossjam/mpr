I've been reading futurist [Jamais Cascio's][3] [*Open The Future*][2] for a while but nothing's come across the transom that was really interesting. At least until now.

[*Sight Licenses*][1] is a short essay on what happens once Augmented Reality lenses become a fixture amongst the populace. Suffice it to say that once vision becomes mediated, mayhem ensues. If you think our current copyright and fair use regime is woefully inadequate in the face of technology, imagine if everything you could see might be regulated in some fashion. 

Perpetual ubiquitous advertising might not even be the worst outcome.
