[Cal Newport][2] generally talks about making a great career, but [today’s missive][1] is applicable to modern mental and emotional health:

> With this in mind, I’m going to stop short of asking you (yet again — I was chagrined to recently learn that I’m the top two results when you google “Quit Social Media”) to consider leaving these services altogether. Instead, let me make a suggestion that the social media industrial complex fears far more: **change your relationship with these services to shift from compulsive to controlled use.**

> Still use social media, if you must: but on a schedule; just a handful of times a week; preferably on a desktop to laptop, which tames the most devastatingly effective psychological exploitations baked into the phone apps.

I will definitely endeavor to follow this advice.
