[Nelson Minar recommends][7] the book [*PostGIS in Action*][3] to supplement the PostGIS documentation. As an example, PostGIS is improving in the area of doing [nearest neighbor searches][4]. 

Alternatively, one can try [SpatiaLite][5] which embeds GIS capabilities in the self-contained [SQLite][6] RDBMS. However, I found SpatiaLite had a lot of moving parts and didn't get a lot of mileage out of it.

*Sideways observation:* [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) doesn't make individual item URLs obviously visible in its HTML. A little digging in an RSS feed reveals their existence. Turns out, on the person's web page, the dates are the permalinks for the bookmarks. Useful for giving credit.
