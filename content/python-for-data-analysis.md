Looking forward to digging into some [**pandas**][4] on my iPad.

Couldn’t stop at just one though, and had to grab the 2nd edition of [*SQL and Relational Theory*][2] by C. J. Date along with [*Data Analysis with Open Source Tools*][3]. I was pleasantly surprised by the table of contents for the latter. A bit meatier than I anticipated.

If you’re reading this on July 3rd, 2012 you can still jump in on the deal. Clock’s ticking though. Midnight PDT is when it expires. Also, of note that it’s only on a particular 25 e-books.
