A bit out of gas tonight, but couldn’t let the end of the Wizards season go past without at least some mention. Maybe a longer post to come. 

I don’t know if it was a good season for the Wiz, but it was an interesting one. A horrific start, a bumpy middle with some great highlights, and back to the losing to close out the season. Injuries were the big story of the season, followed by glimpses of potential from a backcourt of Wall and Beal. 

Next season looks promising, but there's some trepidation. The GM? Well he’s still the GM. Made some good moves this past year, but the past choices still glare, read Jan Vesely.

Props though to Randy Wittman for a good coaching job this year, under tough circumstances.
