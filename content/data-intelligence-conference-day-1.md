As [advertised][2], today I attended the opening session of the local area [Data Intelligence Conference][1]. Overall, an enjoyable start. The talks I witnessed were good, on target, and eclectic. Not super deep on tech details or science, but generally thought provoking.  

I’ve been there for a few meetups, but the Capital One space is even more impressive when in full conference mode. Also have to give the hosts credit for tasty lunch and break vittles. Plus, there were quite a few employees hanging out and chatting, leading to interesting discussion.
The hallway track appeared to be vibrant although it’s been a while since I’ve done that heavily.

Due to an unfortunate scheduling snafu, it doesn’t look like I’m going to be able to attend the next two days. I suspect that Saturday will be the premier session, with a number of top notch talks, heavier attendance, and a quality after hours event. Ah, well!

If you have the interest, opportunity, and finances, I’d definitely recommend attending.
