Some, admittedly self-interested, parties are [projecting a billion a year Hadoop industry][3]. Some are just projecting that [2012 will be a big year for Hadoop][4]. Given that [Hadoop][5] is the open source version of MapReduce, I might actually be on target with that prediction.

But enough self-congratulation. I found myself recently wondering what's next on the MapReduce frontier. Should have known there's [an academic MapReduce workshop][1] for that. Third edition no less.
