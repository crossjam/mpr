As [advertised](http://crossjam.net/mpr/2008/12/2009-todo-a-proper-burial-nmh.html), I've been doing a little work getting [the remnants of *New Media Hack*](http://crossjam.net/nmh) back to life on the web. The style sheet for the archives is busted, and I'm sure there's plenty of linkrot. Much work to do to clean up some of the rougher edges, but maybe it'll come back to life in the Google index. Interestingly, I managed to resurrect an old version of [MovableType](http://movabletype.org/) so that I could reconfigure and regenerate the site from my laptop. From a tar file and a MySQL database dump, things were pretty straightforward.

[*New Media Hack*](http://crossjam.net/nmh) was my old blog. Most of the posts were authored when I was a professor at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu) in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu). Looking back, there was a lot of good, forward looking material in *New Media Hack*. I'm glad it's back on the web in some form.

[*Mass Programming Resistance*](http://crossjam.net/mpr) will always be a distinctly different beast, much less hardcore CS for example. However, MPR will always owe a debt to NMH. I'll be digging around NMH and linking from here to some of the better posts.
