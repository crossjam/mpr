I follow [@PyPi](https://twitter.com/pypi) on Twitter, which just streams Python package announcements. It’s a cheap way to get exposure to new and interesting modules. But everyday it seems like there a couple of newly minted 0.1 packages for “printing nested lists”. Curious but not worth investigating.

[Curiosity satisfied][1] thanks to the [Python Reddit][2], another useful place for Python developments:
> They're generated by people following along an example in the book Head First Python.

> The book's author has amended the lesson (through errata and next edition I guess) to point learners at testpypi.python.org (which didn't exist at the time the book was written).

> I run a cleanup script that deletes them every now and then. I haven't run it for a while... I'll put it on my looong TODO list...
