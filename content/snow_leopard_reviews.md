I was going to point out a few good ones, but Gina Trapani already has the [Snow Leopard review roundup][1]. Oddly though, she left out [the Engadget review][2], which I thought was cool because it had a bunch of videos.

I preordered Snow Leopard, so I should have a copy soon to install. Overall the verdict seems to be "lots of good stuff, but not a **must have**". One improvement that's intriguing is [the upgrade to Services][3]. I never quite understood how the feature was meant to work, but it looks like it's been cleaned up a bit.

But boy, were there **a lot** of Snow Leopard reviews. And Ars Technica hasn't even posted their typical hyperdetailed accounting.
