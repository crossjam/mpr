At this point in time *(1:53 left in the Green Bay vs New Orleans game)* it's sort of hard to complain about the results. I got Aaron Rodgers *(Cal product!)* with my second pick and he's currently racked up 25.77 fantasy points.

Still with the 6th position in a snake draft I was actually disappointed with my selections quite quickly. The problem is that I was really indecisive with my strategy. Conventional wisdom is that you focus on getting two top running backs, but that strategy never really works for me. I thought I was going to follow that strategy, then waffled, then didn't do a good job with my wide receivers. It wasn't so much that I didn't get great receives, it's that they both have the same bye week! And did I mention both of my running backs have the same bye week. Yup you guessed it. The same week as my receivers. **Stupid.**  Now I've got a big roster scramble coming up in week 5.

Draft details after the break.<!--more--><p>
Overall selection #'s in parens:

1.	(6)		Rashard Mendenhall (Pit - RB)
2.	(11)	Aaron Rodgers (GB - QB)
3.	(22)	Steven Jackson (StL - RB)
4.	(27)	Miles Austin (Dal - WR)
5.	(38)	Jason Witten (Dal - TE)
6.	(43)	Santana Moss (Was - WR)
7.	(54)	Mark Ingram (NO - RB)
8.	(59)	Ahmad Bradshaw (NYG - RB)
9.	(70)	Julio Jones (Atl - WR)
10.	(75)	Ben Roethlisberger (Pit - QB)
11.	(86)	Rob Bironas (Ten - K)
12.	(91)	Chicago (Chi - DEF)

According to the Yahoo! average draft, I might have overreached on Jason Witten, Santana Moss, Julio Jones, and Mark Ingram. Then again I got a little bit of a steal on Ahmad Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger. With an eight team league, there's not much of a premium on QBs after  Rodgers, Brady, and maybe Brees. But I'm hoping to parlay Big Ben into some talent with a trade later in the season. Somebody's QB has to go down this year!

I'm guessing my team will go as Aaron Rodgers does. Running back might be a strength, might be a bust. If Tony Romo comes back big, Miles Austin could be a solid number one receiver, but my number two is going to be a pain all year.

And I can't stress enough how stupid not managing the byes was. Lesson learned.
