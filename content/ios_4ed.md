I joined the rush and updated my iPod today. Gizmodo *(yeah I know, they're probably on the wrong side of that "lost" iPod issue)* seems to have a pretty good breakdown of the new features, going deep into [the main feature list][2], and then even deeper into some ["hidden" features][3]. Many of the new features are obviously [iPhone 4][4] related, but there are a couple that are of interest to me.

The biggest one is [iBooks][5]. I doubt that I'll be reading a ton of books on the iPod but I'm going to give it a test drive. There seems to be a fair amount of free material and each book seems to have a sample. I've already grabbed Charles Stross' [*Overtime*][6], a [Laundry][7] short story, as a freebie, and a sample chapter from William Gibson's [*Neuromancer*][8].

I have to admit, *"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel."* looks pretty good, even on such a tiny screen.

Meanwhile, looks like [iTunes is still **teh suck**][9]. Oh, now you can edit playlists on the Touch, even if you can't read the long titles. Sigh!
