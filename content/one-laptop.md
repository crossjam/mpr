Just a few random thoughts on my iPhone 4 even though it too is getting a little long in the tooth. First, the dang thing is pretty doggone beautiful. Probably like many folks, I got suckered into buying an ugly case before I walked out of the AT&T store, on the pretense of protecting it from a fall. Recently I just took the dang case off and decided to live with the consequences. The iPhone 4 is a sweet looking device and deserves to go unadorned.

Second, the device has gotten me down to typically transporting one laptop and often no laptop. For a while I was lugging my personal MacBook along with my work machine. I was under the delusion that there was enough personal stuff needing doing that I had to have my own machine at all times. Turns out all I really needed to do was 1) check e-mail and occasionally respond, 2) check bank accounts, and 3) keep up with my feeds in NetNewsWire. Well the iPhone takes care of that, gives me the web, provides my GPS navigation, and even let's me keep up with my posting. 

People bitch about not getting jetpacks but hell, you got a [ParcTab][1]. Beats flying around looking like a dork.
