[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Redis Tutorial Cover.jpg" alt="Redis Tutorial Cover.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="112" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] I've [talked about][3] the key/**datastructure** store [Redis][1] before. There's been a lot of interesting progress over the past few months leading up to a [stable 1.2 release][4].

[Simon Willison](http://simonwillison.net) put together [a great presentation on Redis][1] for a [European NoSQL conference][5]. On the web, it's essentially his slides + the notes he used for the presentation. The really excellent aspect is his focus on practical examples of how to use the various features of Redis. Really good stuff.

Sparked by his slide on `redis-cli`, I had an idle thought about how it might be fun to trick out [IPython][6] with a bunch of extensions for interacting with a Redis DB. One of these days when I get a round tuit.
