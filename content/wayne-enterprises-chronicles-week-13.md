That makes for four wins in a row. RG III closed the door on Monday Night Football, but if I’d have started Cam Newton, the deal would have been done Sunday night. 

On my side, it was mostly pedestrian performances with RG III scoring 18, Arian Foster and Stevan Ridley for 13 apiece, and Tony Gonzalez *(Go Bears!!)* for 17. I will pat myself on the back though for grabbing Cecil Shorts off of the waiver wire and getting 17 points out of him.

I also lucked into my opponent’s QB, Drew Brees, having an uncharacteristically bad game, delivering 1.37 points. Brees is usually good for 20+. Hey, whatever it takes.

Now I’m locked into the first or second seed for our fantasy playoffs with one regular season game to go. Need a little help, but I already like how week 14 is working out.
