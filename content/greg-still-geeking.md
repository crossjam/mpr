I‘ve been [a fan of Greg Linden][3] for a loooong time. Heck, he even [tipped me off to MapReduce][4] back when it was just a moderately interesting distributed programming model and well before it was a hip ecosystem. Although now he‘s much more intermittent, I still enjoy his posts which are much more link dumps, [such as this][1], these days. 

I suspect he‘s adding more depth over at [his G+ abode][2], but that‘s One Social Network Too Many © for me.
