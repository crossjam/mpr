One of the unfortunate things about <a href="http://crossjam.net/mpr/2008/08/happiness-is-a.html">moving to a MacBook</a> for personal computing is the iTunes hegemony. I mainly listen to DJ mix CDs which makes me a very playlist oriented type of guy. iTunes is radically track oriented and over time I've found a number of "playlist hostile" warts. For example, I've never figured out a way to select multiple playlists and move them to my iPod.

But my biggest gripe is that iTunes doesn't support streaming of music in Ogg Vorbis format. This is obviously a complete geek Rube Goldberg setup, but I have an <a href="http://www.icecast.org/">icecast</a> server setup on a UNIX machine, which I can drive from any remote shell with a combination of <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/">mpd</a> and <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/ncmpc.shtml">ncmpc</a>. What can I say it works for me, and anywhere I can ssh from I can get to my music. Not to mention I can geek out and write scripts to control my jukebox.

Just for grins, I decided to download <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a> and give it a go. Dang if it didn't do the right thing straight off of the disk image! It's glitchy in a few places, for example there's a noticeable lag when navigating playlists, and sometimes the streams skip. But Songbird's got the right price and it fills an unfortunate hole in iTunes.
