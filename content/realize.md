So in my continued [possession][5] by Evol Intent's [*Us Against the World*][1] mix CD, I got captivated by the following, perceived sample:
> *Did you realize no one can see inside your view? / Did you realize the one inside belongs to you?*

You can always distinguish [the ethereal Beth Gibbon's][6] vocals, especially from a great [Portishead][2] track like *Strangers*. But I wanted to be sure I had the correct lyrics, since it's a little tricky to make out. All I kept finding though was this:
> *Did you realize no one can see inside your view? / Did you realize for why this sight belongs to you?*

spread across a bunch of sites designed to sell ringtones. I wasn't hearing any of that *for why…* stuff though which made me suspicious. Turns out that's from the Portishead [*Roseland NYC Live*][3] version of *Strangers*. 

However, going back to the original [*Dummy*][4] CD, I heard the following:
> *Did you realize no one can see inside your view? / Did you realize the world inside belongs to you?*

With some confirmation from the web, mystery solved. You're welcome America!
