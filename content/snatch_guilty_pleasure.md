The original [New York Times movie review][2] spoke fairly favorably of the film and it was a Critic's Pick. However, [Ebert was a bit down on the film][3] thinking it a tad too similar to Ritchie's previous [*Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels*][4]. Maybe it's Ritchie's marital association with Madonna that engenders the guilt.

*Snatch* is a fairly comedic, frenetic gangster romp, set mainly in England. A garish cast of dumb thugs conveniently run into each other repeatedly across multiple plot threads. Ritchie's hyperkinetic editing style keeps things moving. Some highlights:

* Brad Pitt playing a well-nigh incomprehensible Irish Gypsy boxer.

* Character names like: Brick Top, Turkish, Franky Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth Tony, and Boris "The Blade"

* Tyrone as not the most nimble, of mind or of foot, getaway driver.

* Jason Statham's typical cool machismo. He's not completely monotone in this one, exhibiting a bit of comedic timing.

* Benicio Del Toro masquerading as a Hasidic Jew to rob an Antwerp diamond broker. *Vere is da stoooone?*.

* Nicola and Teena Collins as easy on the eyes twin daughters of Doug "The Head", a wannabe Jewish diamond dealer.

What clinched *Snatch* as a keeper for me was when Cousin Avi, Dennis Farina, responded to the customs officer's "Anything to declare?" with "Yeah. Don't go to England".
