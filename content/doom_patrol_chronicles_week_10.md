I'm running a **bit** late this week, [as if you even cared][1] about my fantasy football teams. I've got a good excuse though. On Monday [a friend of mine][2] went up into orbit on the Space Shuttle as a member of NASA mission STS-129. My family was lucky enough to be invited to attend the launch. More on that later in the week.

In the meantime, I went a satisfying fantasyland 3-1 last week.

Doom Patrol Prime provided the big surprise win. I was playing the #1 team in the office league, trailing by a game. The projected scores were close but the opponent has been consistently overachieving while I've squeezed out a few lackluster wins.

Having Randy Moss go off against the Colts on Sunday night was a big thrill. I was also helped out by Maurice Jones-Drew pulling up short of the goal line and getting one less touchdown. My margin of victory was less than 1 point. *Thanks MJD. Way to do the right thing.*

Now that I'm tied for first in this league, I'm feeling a little bit better about my playoff prospects. Still, there's a bit of a scrum only two games away in the loss column. I need to keep winning.

Doom Patrol Beta ground out a soporific 30 point win scoring only 70 fantasy points. Two thirds of my team underperformed, but my opponent played a bunch of Steelers and got burnt when the Benglas held them to 12 points. At 9-1 in this league with 4 games left, I'm in great shape to make the playoffs. Just want to keep the momentum going and optimize my lineup for the last couple of weeks of the season.

Justice Society fell again. I pretty much played the optimal lineup that could be played, but just didn't have the firepower. Still scheming to get this time over .500 by the end of the season.

The New Mutants just squeaked by. I had three double digit scorers while my opponent had two. The rest of the players on both sides were pretty pathetic, with only one reaching the end zone. I got just barely enough receiving yards to get the victory. Still a win is a win.
