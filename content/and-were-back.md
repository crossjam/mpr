A month or so off felt pretty good. Lots of great stuff out there in the RSSsphere, despite [the coming apocalypse][2]. [This choice nugget from Cal Newport][1] on building a great career really hit home:
> The courage culture paints a tempting picture of how people end up with remarkable lives. It tells a story where you’re the main character, fighting evil forces, and ultimately triumphing after a brief but intense battle.

> The reality is decidedly less exciting. Remarkable careers require that you become remarkably good. This takes time. But not necessarily a string of defiant rejections of some mysterious status quo.

As for feed reading, I’ve stashed my feed list, and may just [go Brent Simmons][3] and live with [the next NetNewsWire][4].
