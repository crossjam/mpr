The old graybeard general wisdom was that one never took a x.0  release seriously as there were bound to be bugs. Still, I'm mildly intrigued as at work I have multiple millions of geolocated objects stored in [PostGIS][2]. There are a few queries that could use any help they can get. Then again, I really need to sit down, do some analysis and benchmarking, and really understand the distribution of my data.

Still, maybe a squeaky new PostGIS can help in the performance arena. Hopefully, the query selectivity has been improved at least.
