Nothing like a chain of 30 second spots right in the middle of *Pulp Fiction* or *Basic Instinct*.

Sad, because IFC introduced me to Matthew Vaughn's [*Layer Cake*][2] which is similarly brutalized by commercials. Hard enough to get in synch with the British accents, but the cognitive interruptions just spoil the whole thing.

Alright, I'll admit I still watched most of *Basic Instict*. Nothing can stop that Sharon Stone freak show.
