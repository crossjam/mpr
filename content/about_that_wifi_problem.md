Might have spoken a bit too soon about [a solution to my WiFi woes][1]. Seems like my network connectivity is a bit hinky if I roam too far away from my WiFi base station. Intermittent blackouts are combined with too frequent brownouts.

Distance seems to screw things up, even if I'm plugged in. Yuck!!
