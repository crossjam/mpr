This is just of general interest to me, but there’s also the specific angle that I’ve personally met the guy who trademarked “bigdata”. Smart guy. Was wondering [where that term actually originated][1]. Will be stuff of lore for years to come.

> The term Big Data is so generic that the hunt for its origin was not just an effort to find an early reference to those two words being used together. Instead, the goal was the early use of the term that suggests its present connotation — that is, not just a lot of data, but different types of data handled in new ways.
