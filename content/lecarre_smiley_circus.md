Instead of the common comprehensive look at the past year, I’m going
to close with focused observation on one specific thing I did this
year. 

Read a lot of spy novels.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The tally.

- [John le Carré][1]

    * _Call for the Dead_
	* _A Murder of Quality_
	* _The Honourable Schoolboy_
	* _Smiley’s People_
  
- [Mick Herron][2]

	* _Slow Horses_
	* _Dead Lions_
	* _Real Tigers_
  
- [Tom Bradby][3]

	* _Secret Service_
	* _Double Agent_
  
- [Alma Katsu][4]
	
	* _Red Widow_
  
- [Michael Holzman][5]

	* _Spies and Traitors_
	
That’s over one third of my total books completed in 2024 😮. A few
years ago, I stumbled upon the 2011 film version of [_Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy_][6]. Then last year I read the actual novel by [John le
Carré][11], along with inhaling [_The Bureau_][7], and enjoying [_Slow
Horses_][8]. This year I went further down the rabbit hole adding
novels from Herron, Bradby, and Katsu, topped off by Holzman’s
historical piece. I’ve even got a local library hold on the DVDs for
the BBC treatments of _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_ and _Smiley’s
People_.

Ultimately, this turned into an expedition of precursors and
successors for The Circus (le Carré’s fictional intelligence agency)
and [the Karla trilogy][9]. le Carré, with a minor career in
intelligence, was contemporaneous with [Kim Philby][10]. Philby’s
treachery was branded into British culture and an inspiration for the
traitor Bill Haydon in _Tinker, Tailor..._. According to Wikipedia
when Philby was outed he took le Carré’s career with him. The _Slow
Horses_ tales have many echoes of the Karla trilogy and could even be
viewed as the best modern update on le Carré’s oeuvre. Not to mention
the humorous juxtaposition of Gary Oldman playing both George Smiley
and Jackson Lamb.

_Red Widow_, from yet another intelligence agent, gets into the
smothering paranoia at the CIA. A paranoia originated and fostered by
James Jesus Angleton as documented in _Spies and Traitors_, due to
Angleton’s own betrayal by Philby. _The Bureau_, of French origin,
goes deep into the twisted psychology of spy work and even features a
senior counter-intelligence officer with initials JJA.

The Karla trilogy is rightly lauded as great literature. The writing
is extremely dense relative to modern novels but there are many
brilliant passages. Even moreso, things that aren’t committed to the
page often speak just as loudly as the written words. The plotting is
supremely intricate but not overwhelming if one is focused. The climax
of _Smiley’s People_ has you holding your breath.

Now to my final observation. With a surface reading, George Smiley is
the hero of the Karla trilogy and the soul of British
perseverance. Gentlemanly, scholarly, and oft put upon, he is
steadfastly loyal to England and The Circus. A legend of the service,
he eventually "triumphs" over his opponent Karla.

Yet Smiley is actually a quite sad figure. In each of the Karla
novels, he gets burnt by an extreme miscalculation or oversight on his
part. He’s constantly betrayed by people on his side, including his
own wife. His understanding of Karla’s motivations are completely
wrong. The final victory is enabled by multiple strokes of good luck,
accelerated by the venal incompetence of Karla’s underlings, and
completed by appallingly underhanded methods.

At the end of the day, le Carré makes one wonder if the global
intelligence apparatus is worth the fuss. Or is it just an
interdependent collection of dirty, shadowy, self-preserving
bureaucracies that actually achieve nothing.
