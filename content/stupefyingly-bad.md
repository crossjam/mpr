Tonight’s game against the Wizards was the first I’d seen of the Bobcats on an “extended basis”. In front of an empty Monday night house in Charlotte, the Wizards had a 30 point lead well into the fourth quarter. And it didn't even feel that close.

There’s nothing I can really put my finger on in terms of why the Bobcats suck so bad. They don't really have a bona-fide star other than Kemba Walker. Then again, the Wizards really only have John Wall.

But enough of those losers. Yes I know the Wizards aren’t really winning. The level of play has taken an uptick though. They're not getting mocked on SportsCenter on a daily basis. Guys like Kevin Seraphim, James Singleton, and Cartier Martin are proving surprisingly serviceable, although on a good team they'd be on the the end of the bench. 

And at the end of the day, Jan Vesely is showing real signs he might pan out, which would be a coup for Ernie Grunfeld *(still needs to go)*.
