I’d heard about the tool many times, but I just started using
[`pgcli`][1] to interact with [PostgreSQL][2] databases from the
command line. 🤯

`pgcli` is really good stuff. [Auto-completion][3], [syntax
highlighting][4], [Emacs style key bindings][5], and [ssh
tunneling][6], amongst many other [great features][7]. And
[implemented in open source Python (BSD license)][8] to boot. What’s
not to love?

Why did I wait so long? What the hell was I thinking?
