I pretty much went with the notion that the talks were going to be the centerpiece of my PyCon. But it's pretty clear, that while the talks are solid, they should **not** be what one goes to the conference for. It should really be about interacting with the larger community of Python enthusiasts. Let me give you an example.

Despite my miserable condition, I did make it to a few talks. One, by Frank Wiles, was on [the uses of `plpython`][1], a Python embedded in the PostgreSQL database. I have a little knowledge of the subject from a project at work.

Frank did a great job, but I thought he left out one key potential use case. PostgreSQL supports the notion of “table functions”, which allows a procedural function to return multiple, multi-attribute values. Said results are treated much like an SQL table, and can be used **anywhere a  table expression can**. This means you can do fun things like joins against the results of a procedure call. The utility is **awesome**.

After Frank's done, I feel it's my public duty to let others know about this awesomeness. So I shamble up to a mic, grunt out a few hoarse sentences that include the phrase “table functions” and nod my head at the response.

After that, a couple of other seasoned PyConners, Charlie Clark *(all the way over from Europe!)* and [Catherine Devlin][2], spend some time chatting me up. If I was feeling better I would have tried to arrange to meet one or both for a drink later. Charlie was kind enough to almost instantaneously send me a couple of interesting papers on sophisticated PostgreSQL usage.

There was a lot of stuff like that at PyCon. A lot of opportunity to **do** stuff (besides watch a presentation) with others: tutorials, parties, expo hall, open spaces, poster sessions, programming sprints, programming contests, a 5K run, the hallway track. 

To maximize your time at PyCon all you have to do is make the effort to speak up a little. It can even be as simple as saying “Hi!” to someone you've never met before.
