Was talking with a colleague at work and noted that April's first week, Monday to Monday, might be the best week in sports:

* **NCAA Men's Basketball Championship:** Okay Kentucky was  impressively the best team in the land, but I’m still waiting for this one to be vacated.
* **NCAA Women's Basketball Championship:** I don't care who you are, [40 games in a row][1] is spectacular. But Baylor also beat two #1 seeds in the Final Four including Notre Dame for the second time in the season. They also beat perennial blue bloods Tennessee (twice also!) and UConn, along with last year's national champion Texas A&M (twice also!). Definitely not a creampuff schedule.
* **Major League Baseball Opening Day**: We'll ignore whatever the hell that was [over in Japan][2]. Frankly, I’m not sure baseball has opened until the [Cincinatti Red Stockings][3] have played.
* **The Masters:** A tradition unlike any other. Can’t say I'm a huge golf fan *(yet)* but Tiger got me hooked on watching, especially on Sunday.
* **NHL Regular Season Finale:** At least here in Washington, given the Caps situation this year, the NHL playoffs have already started.

The only other week that's comparable is Saturday to Saturday of the last week of March, which includes the first day of the Final Four, but leaves out the last day of The Masters.
