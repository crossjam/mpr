Been meaning to put Talking Points Memo’s [Idea Lab][2] in the ole’ feedroll since Carl Franzen was one of the few [to cover the most recent State of the Map][1]:

> The tensions facing the community were on full display at OpenStreetMap’s annual “State of the Map USA” conference in Portland, Oregon from October 13 through 14, a frenzied, jam-packed series of over 50 presentations and countless other informal talks between avid geographers and programmers who sprawled over a few generally overcrowded rooms at the Oregon Convention Center, fueled by coffee (beer at night) and their boundless enthusiasm for using and improving the vast and increasingly vital public map.
