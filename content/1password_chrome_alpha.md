[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/1Password Icon.jpg" alt="1Password Icon.jpg" border="0" width="128" height="128" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] I was mainly laying off of [Google Chrome][3] because it didn't support extensions. Then when Chrome supported extensions, there wasn't one for [1Password][1], which I can't live without. Then when Agile Web Solutions recently released [a bleeding edge alpha release for Chrome][2], that wasn't working on my machine. Whenever I hit the little 1Password icon, no response.

At least until about 48 hours ago. Oddly, the extension just started working out of the blue. On a whim I decided to hit the button and up popped my login choices. Must have been a reboot I don't remember. Yeah me!

From what little I've done with it, the 1Password extension is nicely executed. One more datapoint of success in case others were wondering. And now I might actually put Chrome to much more use.
