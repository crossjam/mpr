Bye bye [Hurricane Sandy][1]! You got our little development here in Leesburg for two hours of power outage, and our townhouse for a little roof leakage, but otherwise you weren’t too bad. You didn’t even get after my Linode up in the Newark datacenter.

I was highly impressed with your wind gusts though.
