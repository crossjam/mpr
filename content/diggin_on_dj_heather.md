Recently I've started putting an additional DJ in my steady iPod Nano rotation. Another Chicago House music icon, [DJ Heather][1].

It started with [*Fabric 21*][8], and it's great sequence of *Puffin Stuff*, *Feel Alright*, and *Acid Jack*. I wore that CD out when I first got it, and it's still a go to mix when I'm looking for a guaranteed foot tapper.

Picked up [*Dancefloor Principles*][7] which isn't quite as good, but still definitely listenable. *Por Que Amor* is the highlight, while *Mile High Club* into *Wrong* is bumpin'.

Heather's disc for [*House of OM*][6], the other belonging to Colette, might be just as good as *Fabric 21*. I **love** Tracy Cooper's *Uptown*. The Dopeheadz *Now I Got* makes a strong contribution as well.

And lastly, the DJ Heather mix on [*OM Summer Sessions 2*][2] doesn't have any spectacular moments, but I've been enjoying it quite a bit lately. I especially like the tail end of the mix including the sequence of *Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Zoooom*, *Free Your Mind*, and *Don't Clap Your Hands*.

I would link to her web site, but it's a heinous Flash only destination. You'll have to settle for [@djheather](http://twitter.com/DJHEATHER).

Memo to self, purchase the [*Tangerine*][10] and [*DJ International Allstars*][9] mixes.
