While it's been serviceable, I can't say I'm in love with the tool. In an ideal world, I'd have an Emacs mode that interfaced to MovableType.

Now there's a new version of MarsEdit out. ArsTechnica has a good [overview of the latest edition][1]. The big feature is WYSIWYG style rich text editing. Since I write posts using [Markdown][3] formatting, I don't really have a big need for rich text editing. I'll have to give the trial version a test drive to see if there's a noticeable difference, but at $14.95 for an upgrade, I may wait a little bit.
