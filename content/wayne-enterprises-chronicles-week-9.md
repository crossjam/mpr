This one stings because a I had  great projection of 120+ points for my lineup versus my opponent looking at 83.

Key factors:

* RGII didn’t get in the end zone.
* I finally got McFaddened. Run-DMC gave me two points before bowing out in the first half with an injury.
* Arian Foster had a workman like 17+ points. His counterpart on the opposition, Adrian Peterson went for 32.
* No one else on my roster got in the end zone.

The only bright spot was Eric Decker who way overperformed with 25 points.

Just one of those weeks. Unfortunately, now I feel like my team is listing at 5 and 4 instead of cruising at 6 and 3. Still holding second place in the league though.
