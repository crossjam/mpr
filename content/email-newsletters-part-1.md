Herewith, some enjoyable email newsletters that I’m subscribed to.

After leaving O’Reilly Media, Ben Lorica decided to keep up the podcasting bug with [The Data Exchange][3]. [Gradient Flow][1] is his parallel [site][2] and newsletter on the topics of data, business, machine learning, and AI.

[PyCoder’s Weekly][4] provides a nice assortment of Python links. The overall volume and topic distribution works for me.

I’ve been subscribed to [Python Weekly][5] for ages. The number of links is a little higher than is useful to me and the number of unsummarized links has increased recently. That said, there’s usually one or two worth following in every edition.
