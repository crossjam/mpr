One of the things I had forgotten about Cryptonomicon is how much of the book is really a World War II saga. <br /><br />With a lot of unpleasant scenes. <br /><br />Between guys accidentally cutting off their feet, cannibals, concentration camps and just generic war mayhem, the squick factor gets high pretty quick.
