So I’m authoring this during one of the session breaks at [PyCon][1]. Good to be here but I seem to have caught some bug that has me running at half speed. Probably really need to spend a day or two in bed, but we shall muddle through.

Friday keynotes, Stormy Peters and Paul Graham, were entertaining, especially Graham. Talks I've attended have been good if not spectacular. 

Definitely worth the trip so far!
