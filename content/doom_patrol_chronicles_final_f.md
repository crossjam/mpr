Here's one last blast for your amusement though.

Quick synopsis:

1. Doom Patrol Prime are **League Champions** in the all important office league. Fantasy bragging rights for a year baby!!

2. Doom Patrol Beta are also **League Champions** in a random Yahoo! pickup league, but with a different scoring format, thus demonstrating yours truly's fantasy proficiency.

3. Justice Society had a head-to-head play-in game to make the fantasy playoffs in an ESPN league, and lost by 5 lousy points. I arguably misplayed one or two matchups, but they were coin tosses to begin with.

4. The New Mutants made the fantasy playoffs in an NFL.com league, but were one and done. Emblematic of this team's collapses this season, I only got one stinking QB touchdown out of all the players. Nobody produced except for my kicker and DST.

3 out of 4 in the playoffs with two championships. Not bad for a third year player. The key for me was seriously and continuously working the waiver wire. By the end of my office league's season, I was beating people with Beanie Wells, Jerome Harrison, Brent Celek, and Jermichael Finley, players who weren't fantasy drafted and often available halfway through the season.
