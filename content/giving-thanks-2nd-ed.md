I wrote a pretty darn good [“giving thanks” post][1] last year. It’s still mostly in effect, so go read it again.

I’ll add two things for this year.

1. **Health and Auto Insurance.** You don’t need ’em til’ you need ’em, but I needed both this year. And I’ve been paying into Cadillac plans, which have now paid me back.

2. **Our Veterans and Servicemembers.** Working for a defense contractor you get an appreciation, but I’ve noticed a national uptick in public recognition as our wars wind down. I also got the rest of the story on why my did didn’t make it to the hospital for my birth. Drafted into the Army, he was escorting a casualty home. 

Thanks to one and all who have, or do, help defend our country.
