A tough get, but I had the overall #1 pick, Arian Foster going. 120 yards and 2 touchdowns was definitely doable.

152 on the ground. 1 touchdown. 1 reception for 16 yards. 23 fantasy points.

**And I lose by a lousy half a point!!**

Foster did his part. The actual killer was Stevan Ridley of the Patriots giving up a fourth quarter fumble that cost me 2 points.

Given that my quarterback, Rober Griffin III, got knocked out and only supplied 3 points, I probably shouldn’t have been in the game anyway. But Tony Gonazalez had another big day with 24 points. Meanwhile, my kicker and defense provided double digits as well. 

Need to get more production out of my wide receivers, but dang did that one sting!
