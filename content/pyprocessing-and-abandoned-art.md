Download the [processing](http://processing.org) sketches at [AbandonedArt][1]. Upload sketches to [github](http://github.com). Clone each sketch, see how well it comes out in [pyprocessing][2], fixup as needed.
 
Can be worked on in small discrete chunks. Public visibility would be nice and maybe others would join. And it would provide good feedback for the pyprocessing project, maybe leading to contributions.
