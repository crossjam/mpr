Been a rough patch on the home front for the past few days, but things are looking up. I highly recommend staying awake when driving up I-95. The guard rail alarm is really unpleasant. 

Gotta give thanks though for all the family and friends providing support and well wishes. And thanks that the accident wasn’t worse. Fingers crossed we’ll get over the hump.
