Huge completion haul this month. Some based upon carryover from last
but momentum is momentum. Still, there’s a non-negligible number of
significant tomes if anyone’s counting. This bump’s the year’s count
to 28.

* [_The Manager’s Path_][2], Camille Fournier
* [_The Barcelona Complex_][3], Simon Kuper
* [_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_][4], Patrick Lencioni
* [_The Last Emperox_][5], John Scalzi
* [_Thinking In Bets_][6], Annie Duke
* [_Pep Guardiola The Evolution_][7], Martí Perarnau

Thoughts below the fold.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

_Grendel Omnibus, Volume 2_ continues the Grendel story after the end
of Hunter Rose, into the Christine Spar saga, and beyond. Matt Wagner
has an amazing ability to revisit previously minor characters and
moments in the overall Grendel canon and craft deep compelling stories
around them. I’m not a huge fan of the Brian Li Sung arc and
explicitly making The Grendel (TM) an independent entity, but still
great work.

I thought I only needed one segment of _The Manager’s Path_, related
to senior leadership, but indeed the totality of the actual path from
individual contributer to executive leader is insightful.

Had high hopes for Simon Kuper’s _The Barcelona Complex_ given the
timing of its release, literally within weeks of Lionel Messi leaving
Barcelona. Not bad overall, especially for the insights into Johan
Cruyff, FC Barcelona’s social structure, and the philosophical
entaglements between the two. The book sort of flagged though when
trying to dive into why great players are great players. Given how
much sports media coverage and advanced analytics we have these days,
it’s difficult to say anything smart here. And then it petered out at
the point in early 2021 when Barca got spanked by PSG in the Champions
League but didn’t carry on into the mid 2021 Messi departure saga. Bet
there’s an extra chapter for the paperback.

_The Five Dysfunctions..._ is an enjoyable and popular business fable,
but man is the foreshadowing laid on thick. The key points of team
buildng are definitely appreciated though. At the end of the day one
can read the book but can they execute on the principles?

_The Last Emperox_ was a satisfying ending to a fun trilogy. A
lightning bolt hit me a third of a way through and I realized the
whole tale was somewhat analogous to the climate change crisis. Duh.

_Thinking in Bets_ is a nice exploration of decision making processes
with practical advice on improving them. Definitely not a poker book,
although the element of constant, intense, personalized feedback
shouldn’t be lost. Similar to sports, it’s something that doesn’t
surface continuously in business contexts, other than trading.

_Pep Guardioala The Evolution_ drifted into hagiography but then
fundamentally redeemed itself by deeply diving into how Bayern Munich
operated under Pep’s three years of guidance. The things that stood
out for me where the intensity of the preparation and the subsequent
honest assessment of performances. That’s the hard graft that often
gets lost when admiring Pep’s process. One thing I was interested in
was player recruitment and how Pep engaged with it. Toni Kroos who
made minor appearances in _Pep Confidential_ had disappeared to Real
Madrid by this point. I’d be interested to see how that went between
Pep and the board since Kroos seems like his type of player.
