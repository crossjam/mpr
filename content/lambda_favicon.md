Tweaked the favicon for this site from [the glider as hacker
emblem][4], via Conway’s Game of Life, to [the lambda][1] from the
[MIT/GNU Scheme][2] [logo][3]. Better represents my ties to M.I.T. and
an incredible lecture Gerald Jay Sussman gave my freshman year to
close out 6.001 ( _alas, [a course fallen by the wayside][5]_). The
finishing topic? Conway’s Game of Life and how to build a Turing
complete computer from cellular automata. All in one 90 minute
lecture. Virtuoso!
