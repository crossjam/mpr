There’s [a new release][1] of the WordPress App for iOS.
> This is a big one! The WordPress for iOS dev team is excited to announce that version 3.1 is now available in the App Store. In this update you’ll find a redesign for both iPhone and iPad, along with loads of new features!

Thank goodness. The current editing UI on the iPad is driving me up a wall. Too many switches out of editing mode to do simple things. Hope the new version is a bit more efficient.
