[A HotOS 2017 paper (PDF)][1] authored by Maas, Asanović, and Kubiatowicz, hits on some of the systems trends that have piqued my interest. Definitely from a cloud-computing, datacenter perspective, but vertically integrated programming stacks on top of disaggregated resources holds promise. *Does this make me look buzzword compliant?*

> In this paper, we argue that we should rethink how language runtimes are designed for the Cloud 3.0 era. We do this by laying out seven tenets of building language runtimes for the next generation of cloud data centers. We then distill these tenets into a proposal for a shared substrate to underpin these future runtimes.

With a title like “Return of the Runtimes: Rethinking the Language Runtime System for the Cloud 3.0 Era,” how could you go wrong?

*Brush with greatness, Asanović and I were in the same incoming grad cohort in Berkeley CS. We even had a class or two together.*
