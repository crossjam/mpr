Uh oh! Andrew Gallant has put together two of my favorite tastes: [fantasy football (really sports stats) and Python][1]

> As a programmer and a fantasy football addict, I am embarassed by the meansthrough which we must expend ourselves to get data in a machine readable form. This lack of open source software cripples the community withsub-standard tools, and most importantly, detracts from some really cool andfun things that could be done with easily available statistics. Many toolsare either out-dated or broken, or if they work, they are closed source andoften cost money.

> Yesterday I started work on a new library package that I hope will start toimprove this sorry state of affairs.

> NFLGame is a Python package that provides convenient access to NFLstatistics. This includes games that are currently being played, or games as far back as the 2009 season.

Looks like a definite install. The question is how much of my time it eventually sucks up. Thanks Andrew!

And I know [nobody cares about my fantasy football team][2], but yup, I will be competing in my office league yet again and of course blogging about the season. Super!  Thanks for asking!
