Ran across this word while reading Josh Marshall's note about how [New York is taking its waterfront back][2] from the industrial and commercial concerns that have traditionally owned that essential real estate.

**entrepôt**, *ˈäntrəˌpō*

1. *noun* ( pl. -pôts pronunc. same or |-ˌpōz|) <br/> a port, city, or other center to which goods are brought for import and export, and for collection and distribution.

This according to my Mac OS X Dictionary application. Seems like a word apropos of [Elle Driver's][1] fetish for gargantuan.

*I've always liked that word... "entrepot"... so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.*

Of course the Chicagoan in me wants to point out that New York is simply trying to catch up to Chicago on the public space front. ;-/
