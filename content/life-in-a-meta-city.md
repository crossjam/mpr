Didn't really notice the link to his essay [*Life in a Meta City*][1], but that may get me to buy a copy of this month's Scientific American.

Not to mention that I'm just generally interested in the science of dense urban centers and [the whole September issue][3] is devoted to cities.

I'm guessing he hasn't even started on a post *Zero History* book, but I'm wondering what Gibson will come up with next.
