There’s Mobile Safari of course, a straight up Web browser. Then there’s a nice one hiding in [1Password for iPad][3]. [Mr. Reader][1], my RSS aggregator has one along with the IMDb app. The Google Search app has a browser embedded as well as [Tweetbot][2].

Just an observation. Not sure if it’s good or bad. On the one hand, they’re all relatively consistent. On the other, my Web browsing get’s sprawled all over the place.
