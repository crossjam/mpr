As a long time ponderer of [“The Daily Me”][4] concept, [prismatic *née Woven*](http://getprismatic.com/) has been very attractive. I’ve always been curious about how automated, personalized systems might play out, and I enjoyed [Bradford Cross’][3] blogging when he had the time. But when they first launched needed access to one’s Twitter account to make recommendations. That was a non-starter for privacy reasons and the fact that I wasn’t really following anyone then. I do most of my infotrapping in Google Reader.

Fast forward  a bit and now [Prismatic can connect to your GReader account][1]. So I’m on the bandwagon with yet another personalized news service. Maybe this one will work out better than [the last such service][2] did.
