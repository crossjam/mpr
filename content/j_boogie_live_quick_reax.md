In the Mix*][1] off of the Amazon remainder shelf. I was pleasantly surprised, given that I didn't like the more recent [*Soul Vibrations*][2]. That's partially because the latter is a straight ahead album, whereas *Live!* is a mix cd.

Still, given that I've only had one listen, I was really impressed. It was sort of the downtempo hip-hop Yang to Mark Farina's downtempo house Yin.
