<a href="http://io9.com/people/carnevale/posts/">Alex Carnavale's</a> survey of Simmons' work gives high marks to such works as <i>Song of Kali</i> and <i>Prayers to Broken Stones</i>. Carnavale usefully highlights Simmons' novellas and short stories, which I didn't know about. More grist for the reading mill.
