<blockquote><em>

SproutCore is a tool for building applications. It has more in common with Cocoa or .NET than jQuery or MooTools. Because of that, SproutCore will change the way you think about building web apps.

</em></blockquote>

WebKit, JavaScript, and HTML 5 seem to be Apple's answer to open development, vice the App Store. Then the question is how close can a platform like SproutCore come to the fit and finish, spit and polish, of native Cocoa Touch applications?
