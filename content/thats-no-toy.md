Well after a week and a day I can calmly declare that the 3rd Generation iPad is definitely **not** a toy. 

For me at least, it doesn’t feel like a desktop replacement, but there are definitely some great features:

* There’s enough screen real estate that Web apps are comfortable, although you may have to do a bit of zooming to make buttons big enough.

* [Mr. Reader][5], an iPad app for Google Reader, is delightful. Reasonably priced, a bit more functional, and definitely fresher, Mr. Reader is kicking NetNewsWire to the curb on the iPad.

* Reading books, either through Amazon’s Kindle App or Apple’s iBooks, is gorgeous. Perusing PDFs is enjoyable, although I have to give iBooks bonus points for preserving URLs, whereas Kindle doesn’t.

* Speaking of Kindle, the [“Send to Kindle”][4] app is very handy.

* The device is a great size for watching videos.

* **Bonus** I have the Verizon LTE edition, which allows you to use the iPad as a mobile hotspot for no extra charge.

I’m definitely starting to love this thing although [DJay][6] turned out to be a bit of a disappointment, largely owing to the fact that you need monitor speakers and a cable to handle pre-cueing.  Sort of kills the “mobile” in mobile dj. And authoring posts will probably stay on the desktop, at least until I get to a higher level of performance with the keyboard. The iPad hasn’t found a creative niche for me, but it’s currently a great media consumption device. Of course that’s only after one week, plenty of room to grow.
