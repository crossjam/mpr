In fact, I bought a Titanium G4 MacBook just after the turn of the century and I had purchased LaunchBar for that machine.

Despite shelling out the dollars, I've never actually exploited LaunchBar to its fullest. Oh sure, Command-Space is committed to muscle memory, but I basically use the tool like a smart application launcher.

Last night I tried using it to play an album I had ripped to iTunes so I didn't have to switch to iTunes. It sort of worked, adding the album tracks to a new "Launcbar" playlist, improperly ordered, and hitting play on iTunes. Then I figured out I needed to pick the <strong>playlist</strong> I wanted in LaunchBar and It Just Worked!

Brilliant! I figure it's only really good for favorite playlists and not digging through to find one's you haven't listened to recently. Then again that's the whole point, to save you effort on the stuff you do (listen to) frequently.

Today I was trying to LaunchBar into the URL for <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Image Search</a>. Turns out LaunchBar already has a little widget you can hot key to, enter your query, and pull up the page with your search results. Suhweet!

Might be time to check out that manual. And I will definitely be forking over the dough to upgrade once LaunchBar 5 goes final.
