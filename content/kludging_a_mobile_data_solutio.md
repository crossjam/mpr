So old, I don't even have to **think** about whether I can get a really, cheap phone with a new plan. I was all jacked up to buy an [iPhone 3GS][2] in the next couple of months. What with [AT&T][7], [Apple][5], and [AT&T + Apple][6], recently stumbling hard though, I'm losing my enthusiasm.

A combination of an [iPod Touch][4] and a [Verizon MiFi][3] might be the ticket. See I really care much more about wireless data than voice. The downers of my scheme? A comparable data plan is $40 more than your data increment for the iPhone. Plus the Touch winds up being more expensive since it's not subsidized. Not to mention it's not really a phone, so I still have to do something about that.

On the up side, "tethering" (USB or WiFi) for my laptop is included, something I can't even buy from AT&T today and which they're hinting at will cost extra if they get around to it. I also wouldn't be on AT&T's network. I don't know if usage in DC compares to SF and NYC, but given that this is prime Verizon country, I'm guessing they have better performance.

I hadn't realized that 1) the MiFi was so small, and that 2) you could just power it up and leave it in a pocket or backpack unattached to another device. Depending on local signal quality, this could be just as effective at data as the iPhone.
