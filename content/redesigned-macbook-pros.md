Really, I had no idea about this [MacBook Pro redesign rumor][1] when I posted about [my lust for a 15" MacBook Air][2]. Unclear what the processor, RAM, and storage specs would be but I have to imagine anything with “Pro” in the name should be able to sport 8 Gb RAM. 

I'm guessing that as a first iteration on blending Air and Pro this'll wind up being a premium product. Hopefully it only cost an arm or leg, not both.
