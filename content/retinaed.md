*Apropos today’s announcements.*

Okay. I admit it. I have become a legitimate [Apple fanboy][1]. 

The laptop I’m writing this post on? A 13" 2008 White Plastic MacBook. 

The laptop I do my day job on? A kitted out 15" 2011 MacBook Pro provided at my request. 

My wife’s 2010 Christmas gift? An iPad, 2nd generation, AT&T 3G.

The handheld I use to distract My Little Guy(™)? A fourth generation 64Gb iPod Touch.  

The cellular phone where I take calls, read Twitter with, track my weight, and text on? A 2010 16Gb iPhone 4.

The tablet I carry around just about everywhere I go these days? An iPad, 3rd generation, 64Gb, Verizon LTE. Damn if it ain’t [a sweet product][2].

I’ve seriously considered purchasing an Apple TV and an Airport Express.

Keep in mind that I’m a built my own computer, written my own compiler, written assembly code with some effort, ported X Windows to OS/2, used Linux on floppy disks, Scheme embedding sort of hacker. I’m not quite sure if this state of affairs should be distressing.

In any event, note the last two products of mine that I listed are Apple’s first Retina Display products. I have to say, using both of those continuously, then going back to say the White MacBook display for an extended period, really highlights the difference.

So much so that a Retina Display is a must have feature for the next round of devices I’m lusting after, the next iPhone and a power user’s MacBook Air.

Thus have I been [Retinaed][3].
