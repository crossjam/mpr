Getting a lot of mileage out of:

* [requests][1]. Wasn’t quite ready to believe the hype, but it does make executing HTTP requests a lot more humane
* [ConfigObj][2]. Makes parsing Windows INI files as about as convenient as possible
* [argparse][3]. Once you internalize the Tao of this module, combine with [cliff][4], to make command-line Swiss army chainsaws.
