Javier Vasquez has his usual singularly explosively bad inning, a 6 run fifth, the Sox get way behind, and they can't recover.

Hawk Harrelson said it best, "What we simply have here is two teams with tight butts."

Pretty straightforward for the Sox. The playoffs are here now. Granted, they're technically not facing elimination games, but they really need to start playing like these games are.

It's stunning how quickly the Sox's pitching, starting and middle relief, have gone south. Mark Buehrle's on the mound and today's one of those games where you think this is why he got that big contract extension. We need a Johan Santana like result with Buehrle style. 8 innings, 90 pitches, scattering 5 hits and allowing 1 run for the victory. All in 2 hours.
