Despite [the general putridness][1] of the NBA playoffs, it was good to see the Phoenix Suns show some heart. They won [game 3 at home against the Lakers][2] and look like they have at least a few wrinkles to stay with the current champions. They did this despite shooting crap on three pointers *(siddown Channing Frye, hello Robin Lopez)*. If the Suns win game 4, you're looking at at least another week of Western Conference finals.

Meanwhile, with the Orlando Magic playing like dogs, the Celtics may finish the sweep on Monday night. That means they'd be quite healthy, rested and prepared for the Western Conference champions.

The emergence of Rajon Rondo makes a big difference in the 2007-08 champion Celtics. Since being beaten in The Finals that year, the Lakers have better integrated Pau Gasol, won the 2009-10 championship, and signed Ron Artest. This would be a good rematch. And no guarantee that Kobe would come out on top.

And I'd be remiss if I didn't congratulate the Chicago Blackhawks on making it to the Stanley Cup finals. Championship time in Chicago is just a boatload of fun.
