Although not the greatest video, here's a taste of what *Zero History* is about:

<div align="center">

<object style="margin: 10px;" width="250" height="165"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/biFMsh2g0OM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/biFMsh2g0OM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="250" height="165"></embed></object>

I've said before that I'm in the tank for Gibson. Right now he's the only author I pick up in hardback *([modulo Chaykin][4] of course, but that's a special circumstance)*. This may be the last hardcover I buy ever. One, while I like the [*Pattern Recognition*][2] series, I don't like near future style enough to keep purchasing hardbacks. If Gibson keeps up in this vein, I'll probably start waiting for the paperback editions.

And two, by the time he completes his next book I'll probably be well into e-books.

Speaking of *Pattern Recognition*, I haven't read it in a while. [*Spook Country*][3] came out over three years ago. So I think I'll read the whole set as a trilogy to get the full thematic impact.
