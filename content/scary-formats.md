You know you’ve been hacking when you start to both hate and appreciate the intricacies of [csv][1] file field escaping because you’ve come to both hate and appreciate the intricacies of [JSON’s][2] UTF-8 encoding. Kids, don’t try to put a data format that’s hard to escape by itself inside another format that has, at best, loosely defined escaping mechanisms.

Two great tastes that taste horrible together.

But I did it all for the data, the data.
