Not to mention the fact that it's a sequel of a fairly unintelligent street racing flick. And the new supporting actor is a B-list actor/model/rapper.

Don't know why, but I always enjoy [*2 Fast, 2 Furious*][1]. Some reasons?

* [Paul Walker][2]. He's got just enough acting chops to play the laid back surfer/skater/racer type and make you believe he's not faking.

* [Tyrese Gibson][3] hamming it up, especially when he's confronting the cops and jerking Verone's henchmen around.

* [Ludacris][5] as an illegal street race organizer.

* And of course, lots of eye candy. Special shoutouts to [Eva Mendes][4] and [Devon Aoki][6].

The plot is beyond ludicrous. The setup defies suspension of disbelief. The climax and denouement are strictly by the numbers formulaic. But in-between the start and finish, *2 Fast, 2 Furious* is good old dumb action fun.
