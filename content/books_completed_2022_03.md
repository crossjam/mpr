This is for both March and April of 2022, which is somewhat
disappointing. For various reasons, I just hit a wall over those two
months and didn’t make as reading progress as I would of liked. I was
pretty consistent with my daily read, but usually once I get going
I’ll exceed the allotted time by a significant margin. Not so much
these past two months.

More after the break
