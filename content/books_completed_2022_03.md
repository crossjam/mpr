This is for both March and April of 2022, which is somewhat
disappointing. For various reasons, I just hit a wall over those two
months and didn’t make as much reading progress as I would have liked. I
was pretty consistent with my daily read, but usually once I get going
I’ll exceed the allotted time by a significant margin. Not so much
these past two months.

Here come’s the break ...

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The stories from the _The Hidden Girl_ are worthy of Ken Liu, but
didn’t stick with me as much as some from [_The Paper
Menagerie_][4], but maybe that’s to be expected.

[_Thoughts and Prayers_][5] (mind the horrific ad tech on the previous
link) is the standout for me, in an extremely disturbing and
dispiriting way. I also appreciated _Ghost Days_ demonstrating hacker
nous with its recursion theme and Lisp bits!  Many of the stories had
stimulating engagements with posthuman and post climate change life.

Parts of _High Output Management_ are clearly dated and specific to a
manufacturing enterprise. There are still quite a few useful nuggets
for any manager though. 

_Pep’s City_ is a stapled together collection of vignettes less than a
coherent book. The authors pulled out a couple of good incisive
details that were new to me regarding players like Raheem Sterling,
Kevin De Bruyne, and Aymeric Laporte. Heard more voice of the Spanish
speaking players which makes sense with Spanish speaking authors.
