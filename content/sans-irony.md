[Rafe Colburn’s reference][1] to Christy Wampole’s [*How to Live Without Irony*][2] finally pushed me over the edge and I had to read her opinion piece. A good screed but before one gets all self-congratulatory about not falling for hipsterism, please check out David Foster Wallace’s *“E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction”*. 

Admittedly Wampole is probably quite aware of the essay, but I’m not sure how many in the target audience are. This was the most impactful of the essays I read from DFW’s collection [*“A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again”*][3] and has stuck with me for a very long time. Pretty much convinced me of the corrosiveness of television beyond the silliness of much of the content. Mule Variations has [a good look][4] at the importance of “E Unibus Pluram”, but it’s not a bad way to “ease” into DFW, if there is such a thing.

Hipsters are one thing but good luck assailing irony within mass media.
