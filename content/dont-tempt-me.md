It’s a sad statement of mega-corporation life that while the tumblr for [*Today’s Corporate Meeting Challenge*][1] is really funny, I am actually tempted to try and rise to the challenge.

Even sadder is that I’d be **lucky** to actually be called out in any of the numerous meetings I’m asked, nay required, to attend. Half of these would just go over people’s heads and they’d just forge on.

There should be a separate category for teleconferences. I’m undecided if these monstrosities should garner bonus points for laugh multiplication, or be considered the putting green. Seriously, you can always say the most profoundly stupid things in a telecon if you follow it up with “Sorry. Thought I was on mute.”
