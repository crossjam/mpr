Now I'm down to three subscriptions, [*The New Yorker*](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine), [*Wired*](http://www.wired.com/wired/), and [*Harper's Magazine*](http://harpers.org). *The New Yorker* is the only must read and I'm barely keeping up with that. If it wasn't for a free year tied to an Amazon purchase, I would have let my *Wired* sub expire in December. Frankly, I've come to almost detest the magazine. Overdesigned to a fault with too many pieces that border on sycophancy or smack of manufactured controversy. Despite the cost, I'm seriously considering replacing *Wired* with [*The Economist*](http://www.economist.com/)

I'll always have a soft spot for *Harper's* despite having zero time to read the magazine. Fabulous writing across a wide range of subjects: politics, literature, art, science, fiction. The quarterly folios are something to behold. An article on [a lost shipment of rubber ducks](http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/01/0081345) is one of the greatest magazine pieces I've ever read.

Now the iconic [*Harper's Index*](http://harpers.org/index/) is online. Bravo!

I'm sure it's been done somewhere else, but I have this nagging suspicion that a Web/blogosphere version of the index would do quite well. The tricky part is in the research and not getting sued by Harper's.
