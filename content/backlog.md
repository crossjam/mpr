I don't know how other bloggers do it, but I'm learning that maintaining a backlog really comes in handy to get over those spots where you can't squeeze out enough time to compose a post. With a good backlog, [a great blogging CMS][1] with a decent mobile interface or [app][2], and a smartphone, one can keep that streak alive.

The only issue I'm having with the WordPress iOS App is getting the publication time right. There needs to be a *"set time to now and publish"* button.
