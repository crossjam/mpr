Does what it says on the tin. Guess who has a few years worth of
starred items to retrieve?

**P. S.** Can’t recommend [Feedbin][2] enough as a feed aggregator and
reader. Maybe it’s selective memory, but feels just as good as the
late lamented Google Reader, even though I don’t use the Web frontend
much. That Feedbin has a [solid client ecosystem][3], of which two
apps I use daily, speaks well of the business. I pay for it and my
subscription is on auto renewal. Rock solid and no drama.

Now let’s see if I can’t take advantage of that API.
