[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Tab Mix Plus.png" alt="Tab Mix Plus.png" border="0" width="200" height="150" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />](http://tmp.garyr.net/) Session saving in Firefox through the [Tab Mix Plus](http://tmp.garyr.net/) extension. Saved my bacon on a number of occasions.

[iStats menus](http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatmenus). The menu bar items are cool, as well as the [iStat pro](http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatpro/) Dashboard widgets. Reminds me that I need to make a donation.

[DyDNS.com's](http://www.dyndns.com/) [MailHop Outbound](http://www.dyndns.com/services/mailhop/outbound.html) SMTP service. Pay $15/**year**, get 150 outbound messages **a day**. Beats the heck out of keeping your own SMTP relay up, running, not busted into and not blacklisted. Also supports working around stupid firewalls you see in many travel settings.

[Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#dashboard) in Mac OS X. Oddly enough, I decreased the clock size in the menubar and now I use Dashboard more frequently to check the time. This is making me appreciate Dashboard's utility.

Search templates in [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), although I need to break the muscle memory of doing a Google search through the Firefox URL field.
