This three game losing streak is getting me down. There's really not much analysis to be done this week. RGIII kept me in the game with a big day, but when four out of eight spots are subpar, pulling out a win is difficult. At least my guys took it into the Monday night game where it basically boiled down to Eric Decker on my side versus Antonio Gates for the opponent. I don’t know what the Broncos were thinking, but they weren’t thinking about guarding Antonio Gates.

Bye week hell this round, but I’m pretty decently set. And the opponent is in a tough spot, with three of his key players on the Falcons who are off this week.
