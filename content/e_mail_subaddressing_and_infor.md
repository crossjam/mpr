I've really gotten into [e-mail subaddressing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_address#Sub-addressing) recently. It's a pretty [well known technique](http://lifehacker.com/199280/generate-unlimited-email-addresses-with-gmail). In conjunction with [GMail's](http://www.gmail.com/) labels, filtering, and IMAP access it makes for a really powerful, private bookmarking tool accessible from just about anywhere.

I do a lot of [information trapping](http://futureperfectpublishing.com/2007/09/03/information-trapping-an-interview-with-tara-calashain/). I have three different [GReader](http://www.google.com/reader) accounts: two heavy with tech oriented or work related subscriptions and one I'm growing with more personal, less techy feeds. Not to mention the 77 subs I have in [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/default.aspx). That's four places where I might see interesting links, plus anything useful I come across in plain old browsing.

The one thing all of these applications have is the ability to e-mail a link with ease. [GReader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_reader) will actually e-mail a whole RSS item with an attendant note if you want. Browsers just use your standard e-mail application. I can easily e-mail to `myself+notes@example.com` from just about anywhere.

At the GMail end, I just filter on `to:myself+notes` and mark those incoming messages with the inventive label, `notes`. There's also an option in GMail to remove filtered messages from the Inbox. Now my self notes don't interfere with important incoming e-mail from real people.

Finally, the `notes` label appears as a folder in Thunderbird, which I can synch locally. This also makes for easy reading. To top it all off, I get great search either directly within [GMail](http://www.gmail.com) or with [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/mac/features.html).

This strategy beats [del.icio.us](http://delcious.com), or similar shared bookmarking sites, because it defaults to private not public. Plus posting to del.icio.us is somewhat inconveniently done through a Web interface, or bookmarklet, or something else not as ubiquitous as e-mail. Also, it's easier to suck notes out of an e-mail store than del.icio.us.

I'm thinking about adopting this strategy for TODO management. Probably won't go as [hog wild exploiting GMail](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2008/09/make-magic-with.html) as Steve Rubel though.

*Bonus: GMail also supports [super-starring](http://lifehacker.com/398497/how-to-use-and-search-gmail-superstars), for just that little bit of extra, instant metadata on notes.*
