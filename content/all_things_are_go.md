A wayward new media hack once [wrote that sentence][1], describing Googler Rob Pike's systems tools.

So I enjoyed this article where Pike discusses some of the [motivations behind the design][2] of the [Go programming language][3]. Key takeaways for me were:

* Diversity of expert language design opinion

* A Schemely emphasis on collecting orthogonal features and allowing for powerful composition

* A radical focus on reducing compilation time

So I've failed miserably at [on old goal][5] to learn the [Clojure programming language][4]. Since Pike claims that some Pythonistas find Go quite palatable, maybe I should give Go a shot.
