I’ve really gotten into podcasts recently where once I was just not a fan. They make a great alternative to broadcast radio if like me you’re stuck in transit a lot. Thanks to [Wes Felter’s blog][2], the [Packet Pushers Podcast][1] came across my radar. Definitely deep, meaty, technical stuff and recommended. Now I feel like I actually understand what NFV means.
