This has the nice upside that between TNT, ESPN, and NBA-TV, practically every night there's a game on the flat panel. Many of these are interesting match ups.

Of course the downside of the lockout and compressed schedule is that often these games wind up really sucking. Teams had no real training camp, have no real practice time, and are often playing tired. I'm not sure I've ever seen this many 20+ blowouts. And it's only the first month or so of the season. 

Speaking of which, at this very moment the Orlando Magic are beating the Boston Celtics by 21 points, 58 to 37, at the half. A few days ago the Magic only scored 56 points in **an entire game** against the Celtics.

Makes for good blog writing background noise at least.

**Update**. Don't know if this confirms or disconfirms my assertion, but the Celtics came back from 27 points down to win by 8. Watching Orlando collapse was sort of painful. If not good basketball at least it was entertaining.
