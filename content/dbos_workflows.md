Title: DBOS Stateful Workflows

[DBOS (the company)][1] has come across my radar via two vectors. Ben
Lorica had a [newsletter update][4] and [podcast interview][8] with the
founders. Meanwhile the [open source DBOS framework][2] was mentioned
on a recent [episode of Python Bytes][5].

This could be a useful platform for my purposes, although I’m a bit
hesitant since it’s new and not "boring". However, it builds on top of
PostgreSQL and is the result of [a well grounded research effort][6]
out of MIT and Stanford.

The interview was a bit "salesy" but not overbearing. Also, Lorica
tended to steer the discussion in the direction of AI and agentic use
cases.

From the [documentation introduction][3]

> DBOS is a serverless platform for building reliable backend
> applications. Add lightweight annotations to your app to durably
> execute it, making it resilient to any failure. Then, deploy your
> app to the cloud with a single command.

As a data engineer, the framework is probably worth a test drive to
compare against [Prefect][7] and/or build your own systems.
