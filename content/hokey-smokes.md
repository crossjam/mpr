Yowsa! I actually got [a link-out from dangerousmeta][1]! I’m showing my blogging age here, but I’ve [noted in the past][2] my admiration for the site. Meanwhile, I don’t do any audience tracking or visit analytics at all for MPR. Pretty much have no idea who’s actually reading this stuff, if anyone. So it’s one of those old time, early ’oughts *(yup, [I go back][3] that far)* thrills to see the site title pop up in another feed.
