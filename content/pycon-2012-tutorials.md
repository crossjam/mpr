I need to get out and about in a developer community, independent of the work context. Plus, since PyCon is in Santa Clara, CA, I've got a few peeps I can visit and crash with on the cheap. 

The [tutorials were announced recently][1]. What a juicy slate! I'm definitely doing the Data Analytics I track. After that Data Analytics II looks tempting, but I'm also interested some of the web/DB development À la carte offerings.

Choices, choices.
