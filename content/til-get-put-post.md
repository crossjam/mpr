Over at HackerNews, Today I Learned about a potentially interesting newsletter on API development [“GET PUT POST”][1].

> Welcome to GET PUT POST, a newsletter all about APIs. Each edition features an interview with a startup about their API and ideas for developers to build on their platform. 

Not to mention [an interesting post][2] on [OpenCage][3], a tiny business providing a geocoding API.
