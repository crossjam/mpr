Typically I’m a "meta is murder" blogger. I prefer delivering content
to talking about delivering content. Today I’m making a minor
exception. Mainly for posterity.

Most of the action in the technology space writ large is driven by
AI. It’s close to inescapable. Being an active technologist I’m swept
up in it as well. Even if I wasn’t planning on making it a big part of
the next day job (🤞), I’d likely be diving in out of pure
curiosity.

The topic is big enough and more career oriented that I’m going to
break my work out in the space into another site. [memexponent.net][1]
will house all of my work and thoughts on AI engineering, hopefully
building up a useful portfolio over time.

Where does that leave Mass Programming Resistance (MPR)? To Be
Determined. Here’s a quick laundry list of areas I might take this
site back to in depth

- Popular Media: Books, Music, Podcasts, Movies, Sports, Episodic Series (_is it
  really TV anymore?_)
- Generative Art
- Programming Language Design and Implementation
- Data Management, Data Engineering, and Analytics
- Non-AI Technology

Me being me, there has to be a tech angle. I can’t go pure culture and
criticism though. Just need to find a proper balance.


More to come...
