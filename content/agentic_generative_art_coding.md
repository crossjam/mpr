Following up on [my prior musings][1] about Python and generative art.
Agentic coding could of course be part of building a Processing-like
platform for Python. At the end of the day though, the actual
generative code is **just** code.

What would agentic coding support for generative art pieces look like?
On one hand, you could start very "vibe codey" with almost purely
natural language expressions of what an artist wants. Spit out some
code. Run a visual display. Iterate in natural language.

On the other hand, the agentic framework could assist proficient
coders with leveraging underlying code features of the platform, even
helping with domain specific mathematical, vector graphic, and low
level pixel array manipulation ([bit bliting][2]) languages to support
artistic flair.

Time for some research.
