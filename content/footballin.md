Liverpool has already won the Carling Cup. Chelsea just beat Liverpool for the FA Cup. And The Blues could double through the Champions League finals, although I don’t give them much of a chance against Bayern Munich in Munich. Meanwhile, Manchester City is basically one game away, in which they are heavily favored, from beating out Manchester United for the Premier League title.

The weird thing is that Chelsea and Liverpool are definitely also-rans in the Premiership this campaign. Liverpool is in ninth place in the tables as I write this. If Chelsea doesn’t win the UEFA championship, they might not be in at all next year.  Man City stunk it up in knockout play, European play, and were left for Premiership dead a month ago. One of their top players acts like a spoiled child and another took an extended golf vacation in the middle of the season.

I don’t quite know what to make of “underachievers” taking home so many trophies, but methinks they might be giving out a bit too much hardware in international football.
