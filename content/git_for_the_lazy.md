Link parkin': [Git for the lazy][1]. A sweet and quick introduction to the highly popular version control program git. Jibes with my experience learning how to use [git][2]. However it does highlight one inconsistency that mildly bugs me: the difference between `git reset` and `git checkout` for reversing edits.

I'm sure someone's proposed some kind of aliasing of `git checkout` to a reset.

And I'm sure there's either some reason I've never heard of it, or it doesn't exist. That's the UNIX way.
