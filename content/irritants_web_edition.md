[Tabnapping][1]. Yet another fun-filled, action packed browser exploit. As a tabaholic, I'm particularly vulnerable if this thing breaks out in a big way.

[Tynt][2], or as John Gruber best puts it, ["Tynt, the Copy/Paste Jerks."][3]. <strike>Of course in the process of praising [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) I ran across their usage of this moronic facility.</strike> **Operator error.** I was faked out by Posterous' use of click tracking on links. Tynt is still whack.

In a similar complaint, but much longer standing, [SnapShots][4] hijacking of link hovering really irks me. At least you can turn this off, but if you use multiple browsers on multiple platforms, it gets to be a pain.

And I'm still [chapped about iTunes title scrolling][5] on the iPad Touch.
