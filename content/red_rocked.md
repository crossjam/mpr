Talk about **not** [winnin' time][4]. The Capitals blew a 3 games to 1 series lead over the Canadiens, and [lost game 7][1] in their first round series. Best regular season NHL team. Seeded #1 in the Eastern Conference. At home no less. Out!

The really sad thing is that we are now left with the awful dregs of the Washington area sports scene: The Nationals *okay, so they're above .500, it's still April*, the Orioles, *you can already lock in another losing season*, the Redskins offseason, *[Joey Galloway][2]? Bobby Wade? Yeesh*, and the NBA lottery for the Wizards, *Here's looking at the fourth or fifth pick*.

Actually the NBA draft might be fairly deep this year, so there could be a bit of excitement in this region. Otherwise, dreck as far as the eye can see.

Looking forward to [Red Wings versus Sharks][3] though! Go Datsyuk!
