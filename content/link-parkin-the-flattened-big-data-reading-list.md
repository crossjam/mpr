I’ve already read a bunch of links on [this reading list][1], but there’s some new nuggets. I also like [Lars Albertsson’s][2] take on [the process of building data intensive systems][3]:
> This is a curated recommended read and watch list for scalable data processing. It is primarily aimed towards software architects and developers, but there is material also for people in leadership position as well as data scientists, in particular in the first section. The content has been chosen with a bias towards material that conveys a good understanding of the field as a whole and is relevant for building practical applications.
