If I was a Mark Farina completist, I'd be really tempted by this new [Mushroom Jazz Bundle][1] from [OM Records](http://om-records.com/).

Oh, wait, I am a Mark Farina completist. So I am tempted. Even though I've got every CD in that bundle. Even though I've got the tee shirt. Well, I don't have the poster. So it would boil down to $70 for a signed poster. I guess I could EBay the rest of the bundle to try to break even, but somehow that seems sacrilegious. 

So I guess I'll have to pass. But [more like that][2] please OM Records.
