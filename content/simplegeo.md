So then what? Well I'm not sure, but I'm guessing some geospatial based analysis might be fun.

Enter [SimpleGeo][1]. I don't quite know what their business model is, but I like their [products/APIs][4]:

* **Context**: gives you contextual information about a place.
* **Places**: allows you to search for further Points of Interest (POIs) near a given location
* **Storage**: lets you store, index, and query geospatially tagged data

Plus [SimpleGeo's pricing][3] seems pretty reasonable for hobbyist tinkerer like me. Not to mention they make the PolyMaps library, which seems mighty handy.
