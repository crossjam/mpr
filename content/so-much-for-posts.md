Thanks to [Cult of Mac][1] it looks like [Posts][2] isn’t what I’m really looking for in an iPad blogging app.
> Also missing is Markdown support, John Gruber’s human-friendly markup language. This would certainly be a handy third pane editor in addition to HTML and Rich Text, but again any writers making heavy use of Markdown will likely be using another app to do it. It would, though, let writers add things like bulleted lists and similar.

[Blogsy][3] is in a similar boat, although I made the mistake of rushing out and buying it without due diligence. Th current popular operating mode seems to be the use of a nice text/Markdown editor like [Writing Kit][4], generate the HTML in that app, then ship to an HTML oriented app like Posts.

Feels like a kludge. On the other hand, I’m pretty intrigued by Writing Kit.
