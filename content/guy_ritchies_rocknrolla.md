Took me a while to get around to watching the movie, which was definitely a mistake. *RocknRolla* is a pretty damn good flick.

*RocknRolla* follows the Ritchie standard playbook incorporating multiple threads of somewhat bumbling London gangsters to both comic and action packed effect. The trigger point is a mega-stadium being built by a Russian billionaire, Uri Omovich. Omovich needs certain construction permits "taken care of quickly" and turns to long-standing English crime kingpin Lenny Cole to make it happen. Uri also lends Cole his lucky painting, which immediately gets nicked.

Of course mayhem and hilarity promptly ensue. I shouldn't oversell Lenny and Uri as the movie really revolves around One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Rob, key members of The Wild Bunch crew. *RocknRolla* is a little less frenetic and kinetic than *Snatch*, but it still moves. Plus it's damn funny. *RocknRolla* is really a comedy caper at heart, with a nice dose of action.

Herewith some highlights:

* A great cast including: Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Idris Elba, Jeremy Piven, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Karel Roden, and Toby Kebbell as Johnny Quid

* Great hood names such as, One Two (Butler), Mumbles (Elba), and Handsome Rob

* Some great teasin' and chappin' amongst The Wild Bunch

* Archy's manner which is , well..., rather arch in an exceedingly dry style

* Thandie Newton, as Stella, and Gemma Arterton, as June, are easy on the eyes

* A hilarious dance sequence between Stella and One Two

* The junky philosophical stylings of Johnny Quid and his sidekick, Pedro

* And a great [MacGuffin][3]

The tail end of the movie teased a sequel called "The Real RocknRolla". Looking forward to it.
