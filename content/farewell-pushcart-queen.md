Breaking my embargo on eulogies, I’m shamelessly ripping off my title from [the MetaFilter post][2] that put me on notice of [Jean Merrill’s passing][1]:
> [**The Pushcart War**][3] was one of those childhood books which changed my life forever, teaching me the importance of activism and civic participation. Merrill's stories also show how much fun organising can be. We have lost a great and creative soul, someone capable of introducing young people to issues that matter with passion and a twinkle in her eye.

Along with [*The Phantom Tollbooth*][4], *The Pushcart War* marked my transition to “serious” reader. Yeah, I proceeded to still read a bunch of junk. But I forever knew there would be stuff out there with more heft and style. There did exist a higher standard to seek out and aspire to. I’m still managing to work towards that standard, bit by bit.

*Godspeed, kind lady.*
