[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Alfred Logo.png" alt="Alfred Logo.png" border="0" width="80" height="80" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Still searching for the perfect desktop search application on the Mac, I ran across [Alfred][1]. Relatively new, released on Feb 28th 2010, Alfred seems more oriented towards quick launching of applications. Sort of square in the [LaunchBar][3], [Quicksilver][2], [Google Quick Search Box][4] arena. [Initial reviews][6] highlight that [Alfred's main goal][5] is to be simpler and faster than those alternatives.

Well I'm pretty happy LaunchBar, but I thought I'd log Alfred here just for future reference. Still searching for search on the Mac.
