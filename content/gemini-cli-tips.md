[Tip 16][4] on integrating shell interaction seems particularly
handy. Seems like all the other CLI tools have this in one form or
another, but this tip is a good discussion of the utility of the
feature.

Previously, I found [Gemini CLI][2] to be less effective than Claude
Code. Just last week, Google had a raft of AI announcements, including
a batch of agentic coding [upgrades connected to Gemini CLI][3].

It's probably time to revisit Gemini CLI, although the passel of
agentic coding CLI tools is getting hard to keep track of.
