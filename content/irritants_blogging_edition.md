The amount of self linking in modern weblogs, especially from high level blogging networks such as [Gawker Media](http://gawker.com/) and [Weblogs Inc.](http://www.weblogsinc.com/) The ratio of inlinks to outlinks feels like 5-10 to 1.

The fact that self linking URL's I used in [New Media Hack](http://crossjam.net/nmh), have the domain name wired in. Now my current archives exhibit a lot of linkrot, that's going to be a pain to fix. *Sometimes in The Jungle we smack our own.*

The insane amount of *flair* on many modern weblogs. Back away from the widgets folks.

Blog posts which don't have authorship and dating at the **top** of the post. This goes for news articles as well. Clear, early bylines are good information architecture. They help readers evaluate the timeliness and veracity of the following content.

Item titles in [MetaFilter's](http://www.metafilter.com) RSS feed suck. They're typically not descriptive of the item so you can't easily scan the spew in a reader like NetNewsWire. It'd be nice if they had a feed that just collapsed all of the posted nuggets into one item.
