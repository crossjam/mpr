Oddly they’ve captured a funky double also winning the FA Cup. Meanwhile, 6th place is the best The Blues could do in the Premiership.

Didier Drogba figured large, scoring an 88th minute goal to keep Chelsea alive, giving up a penalty kick that was eventually saved by Cech, and hitting the final and clinching PK. That’s a long way from [the horrible injury][1] Drogba suffered back in August.
