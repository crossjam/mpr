As in previous NFL seasons, I'll be playing in an office fantasy football league, and providing [weekly updates][1], if not more frequent. Even though I was a pretty poor chronicler, the 2010 edition of Doom Patrol at least made the the playoffs last year. Lost my first game, but won the consolation for a third place finish.

This year, I'll be taking it a bit less seriously, especially the league draft which is tomorrow. I've found I've been most successful when I really work the waiver wires well. Last year I had the overall #1 pick, which netted me Chris Johnson of the Titans. Of course [Johnson had a subpar season][2], mainly because the Titans stank for half of the year, which had me scrambling a lot.

Two years ago, I managed to rack up two titles. Time to get back to the mountaintop.

**P.S.** Given Doom Patrol's failure last year, the name got retired. This year it's the [*Plexus Rangers*][3] in action.
