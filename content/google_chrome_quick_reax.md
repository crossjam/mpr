[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Google Chrome Logo.png" alt="Google Chrome Logo.png" border="0" width="100" height="95" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][2] I had a Safari browser tab sitting around with [information on the Google Chrome MacOS Developer Preview][2]. Just got around to downloading and installing a few days ago. I've only kicked the tires a little, but have to say Chrome is pretty impressive, even for a pre-alpha. Page loading is noticeably faster than either Safari or Firefox.

There's exactly one show-stopper from giving Chrome an extended run as the primary browser. Since Chrome doesn't have much of an extension mechanism, [Agile Web Solution's 1Password][3] doesn't work with Google's browser.

1Password has essentially become a part of my Web browsing brain.
