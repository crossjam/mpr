* [*Emissaries From the Dead*][2], Adam-Troy Castro. Basically a mystery with a fairly complex character as the detective. Solid but not great. A few too many named characters eventually wasted for my taste. Plus there's nary a sympathetic one in the bunch.

* [*Spin*][1], Robert Charles Wilson. Essentially a finely crafted character and relationship study with some SF embedded as the driver. Very good. Surprisingly compelling at a human scale, given the interplanetary and interstellar events.

* [*The Lathe of Heaven*][3], Ursula K. Le Guin. A great book. An elegant parable of man's dreams and hubris. Le Guin also demonstrates an amazing facility with language.

* [*Blue Light*][4], Walter Mosely. Freakishly distasteful transforming into goofy mysticism. Didn't enjoy this one. Mosely is probably saying something interesting about race, but I never felt any of the characters as "black", except maybe for Horace LaFontaine. Not to mention *Blue Light* is more fantastic horror then science fiction.

So that's 18 done for the year, and I'm rolling into August with 3/4 of a book done. Gaining on that target goal of 35.

Complete book roster for the year, and some comments, after the break:

While I liked most of what I read, the last five books have been somewhat downers. Unsympathetic characters, apocalyptic scenarios, and distasteful violence abounded.

I'm declaring August "Happy, Happy" reading month though. Lighter works with a more humorous or satirical touch will be targeted. I'm also going to throw in a couple of graphic novels.
