While I hope Wittman is only an interim coach, I have to give him props for the move.
> *“I’m done with young guys (as an excuse), Wittman added. “ If they don’t want to play the right way, young guys aren’t going to play. It does us no good. They’re not going to learn anything when they want to play the way they want to play. All they’re developing are bad habits.”*

Even better, both players were [benched for the start of tonight’s game][1] against the Orlando Magic.
