Link parkin’. Oldie, but goodie, on taking a bunch of git commits and [mashing them into one][1]:

> But one thing occasionally bothers me, and that's pull requests that come loaded with several temporary commits. I often find myself asking contributors to squash those into a single descriptive commit. Not everyone knows how to do this effectively, hence this quick writeup.

I can also attest that [magit][2] makes squashing commits, from within the Emacs editor, quite agreeable.
