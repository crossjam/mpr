Following the Python [PyPi][1] Twitter stream reveals a number of toolkits that help you build RESTful APIs. These modules usually get you most of the way mapping models from an ORM into an API. However, where they’ve always fallen short for me is in easing the generation of search end points. Maybe I’m doing something wrong, but I need more help in 1) handling incoming query args, 2) turning them into searches against the model(s), and 3) generating a RESTful response, especially the resource URLs.

LazyWeb, make it so!
