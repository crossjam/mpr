So reading this [Gizmodo review][1] of Sprint's new smartphone, the HTC Evo, there may finally be a modern phone that I'm willing to buy. I have an ancient 5+ year old phone. I would upgrade to a smartphone (iPhone, Nexus One) but for 1) the added $30+ premium on a data plan you **have** to buy and 2) similar charges for tethering, if it's even supported at all. Actually, if it was only the data charges I wouldn't be put out. But it's **on top** of voice plan, and I really underutilize my voice minutes. I have 4500+ rollover minutes on my current account. That's not a typo. So for my usage pattern, typical plans don't fit my budget.

Also, my personal laptop is my principle computing device. I'm really hoping to get a plan where I can be completely nomadic, and not have to look for WI-FI hotspots.  I want to get on line with my personal computer while sitting in a little courtyard near my office, a nearby park, or during my commuter bus ride.

I've really been [leaning towards buying a MiFi][2], but the HTC Evo might dictate a course correction. Looks like it can be used as a combination of smartphone and MiFI, solving my tethering issues. The latest Android build is nice to have. Plus Sprint is rolling out 4G soon, presumably in the DC area, which is a plus. Bleeding edge speed would be fun. And I would still be off of AT&T's network. What's not to like?

It'll all come down to the subsidized phone price and price gouging on the data premium. My hope is that since Sprint already has a $100 all you can eat plan, and they've got work to do to build their subscriber base, they'll be a bit more reasonable. I can live with $100 a month for unlimited access and mobile support for my laptop *(and iPod Touch)*.
