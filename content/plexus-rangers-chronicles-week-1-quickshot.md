Major disappointment from my running backs. While Stephen Jackson managed to get in the end zone, he hurt himself along the way. Rashard Mendenhall just stunk.

Shot myself in the foot by reading the Yahoo projections and switching the Bears defense out and the Browns defense in.

And I gotta get more than 2 points out of my kicker.
