The event was a much bigger deal than I expected, punctuated for me by conversations with some really high achievers. I also really enjoy visiting The City of Brotherly Love. My accommodations at the Philadelphia Downtown Marriott were quite acceptable, except for one crucial technology element.

**Internet access (wired or wireless, everywhere, even in the lobby) cost $12.95 per day. WTF!!**

I scoff at you Philadelphia Downtown Marriott and your outrageously overpriced Internet access. Thanks to Starbucks, Cosi, and 3G on my iPhone, I partook of none of your price gouging product. It was a touch inconvenient, but that's a few less shekels in your coffers. Shame on you!

Just more incentive to get a [pay as you go MiFi][2].
