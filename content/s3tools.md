> S3cmd is a command line tool for uploading, retrieving and managing data in Amazon S3. It is best suited for power users who don't fear command line. It is also ideal for scripts, automated backups triggered from cron, etc.

Just what the doctor ordered for the continuous Tweet collectin’, S3 storin’, time constrained home hacker. On Ubuntu, cloning the git repo, running a config, and accessing my S3 bucket works right out the box.
