>* On your computer, visit the [Calendar sync page][1].
* Check or uncheck the names of any calendars.
* In the bottom right corner, click Save.

This is how I got shared calendars that I added to my online Google Calendar, which showed up under “Other Calendars”, to become visible in the Google Calendar app on iOS. Once visible, then you can check off the shared calendar to have it become part of the overall calendar view. Handy for incorporating app specific calendars.
