Apologies for the extensive quoting, but I don’t think Cory Doctorow
would actually mind _(too much)_. Pointing back to a 2021 piece on
[Medium][2] (full post) and [Pluralistic][1] (condensed summary,
podcast teaser) entitled [_The Memex Method_][1]. It’s sort of the
inspiration for some of the personal content hacking I’ve gotten
interested in over the last few month.

I’m impressed that simply combining tagging with fulltext search can
provide so much creative fuel.
