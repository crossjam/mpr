TIL Twitter [Gradient Accounts][1]

> Other people on Twitter had noticed them as well and referred to
> them (usually with irritation) as “gradient accounts,” because many
> of their profile pictures are not of human faces or anything else,
> just color gradients. Gradient accounts have usernames that sound
> like AIM usernames: @f41ryluvrr, @urf41ryg1rl, @moonlouvrr,
> @newmoonbaby2, @glitteryxhearts. Through their tweets, they identify
> as overthinkers and dreamers and hot people, and they often profess
> melancholy and romantic longing. The romantic longing sometimes
> clashes with casual misanthropy; the all-lowercase disclosures of
> trauma and malaise are mixed with playful Gossip Girl memes. Their
> content is more popular than I can possibly explain, and they know
> it. 

Was totally media nerd sniped by this, with thoughts of the Marly
Krushkova arc from [_Count Zero_][2] running through my head. Somehow
real people participating in a mass consensual hallucination makes it
even more Gibsonian.
