[Longtime NetNewsWire fan here][3]. Glad to see Brent Simmons has reached [a significant milestone][2] in bringing NetNewsWire to full functionality. With the [feedbin.me](https://feedbin.me) integration NetNewsWire is now really useful on a personal basis. I can once again have a great MacOs desktop RSS experience. Looking forward to what’s coming down the pike.

> After five years of work — including getting the name NetNewsWire back, and a beautiful new app icon by Brad Ellis — NetNewsWire 5 has finally [hit the alpha stage][1].
