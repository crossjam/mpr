I thought I already had it in my digital library, maybe on some Trax Record compilation, but it was missing in action.

These guys were one, maybe two, hit wonders. We'll give them credit for Liz Torres' [*Can't Get Enough*][2] as well, which is also available as an MP3. Both of these cuts wound up on a surprising number of compilations though.

The surprising thing about both *In The City* and *Can't Get Enough* is how "murky" they were. Before the Acid outbreak, most House was fairly positive, well nigh spiritual. *In the City* has the standard House elements, especially the head cutting hi-hat, but the lyrics and mood are really dark.  The song is reminiscent of a trip into the urban jungle gone wrong. *Can't Get Enough* has a similar flavor, and is about a woman who tries to leave a man but come's back to him, not quite crawling.

Definitely musts for the House aficionado.
