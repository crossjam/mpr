But putting it to the principled service of informing The Public, within the current dynamic of Internet social media, is innovative. [Computer Assisted Reporting][3] was just a precursor. As a recovering [new media hack][2] I can appreciate all the roots of this iteration of his work.

Plus, I love this attitude:
