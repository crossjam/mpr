[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/WordPress Logo.png" alt="WordPress Logo" border="0" width="100" height="100" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Given [my disappointment][4] in the current state of MovableType, I gave [WordPress][1] a little more consideration.  I can overlook the Php implementation, but I was a little worried about preserving my old URLs. Some rudimentary investigation indicates that [WordPress' pretty URLs][2] option, some creative metadata extraction from [MovableType][3], and a little scripting could get the job done.

So I'm ready to bite the bullet and give the migration a shot. This is going to be a long term project though, so don't expect any major changes around here soon. In fact, I'll be working a test run on a virtual machine just to be safe.

*Bonus.* This also might be a way to get the [New Media Hack][5] content into a modern blogging system as well.
