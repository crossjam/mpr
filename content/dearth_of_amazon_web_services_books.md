[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/AWS Logo.gif" alt="AWS Logo.gif" border="0" width="164" height="60" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] I've long been an admirer of [Amazon's Web Services][1] products, but not a big user. Recently I've been thinking of doing some tinkering with EC2, S3, SQS, and the like. Given the current popularity of the platform amongst developers *(or maybe my misguided perception of said popularity)*, I thought there'd be more books on the topic.

Amazon itself is surprisingly thin, with only about three to five titles that I can find which are on topic. The only O'Reilly book, [*Programming Amazon Web Services*][2] is over 2 years old. It's probably sufficient to get started, but a lot has happened on the platform in that time.

Seems like there's an interesting opportunity here.
