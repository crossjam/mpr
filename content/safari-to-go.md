TIL there’s [an iPad App for O’Reilly’s Safari Online][1] library of books:
> Now available for iOS and Android devices. Safari To Go is available for free and delivers full access to thousands of technology, digital media, business and personal development books and training videos from more than 100 of the world's most trusted publishers. Search, navigate and organize your content on any WiFi or 3G/4G connection. Plus, cache up to three books to your offline bookbag to read when you can't connect!

Works great for me since my employer provides Safari accounts!
