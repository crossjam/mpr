L. M. Orchard had [an intriguing reference][2] to a _narrative table
top role playing (TTRP)_ game, entitled [_Last Tea Shop Complete_][1]

> Last Tea Shop Complete is a revised and expanded version of a
> one-page solo game about tea and conversation. Set up your stall and
> wait for visitors to emerge out of the mist. Over a cup of tea, chat
> to the visitor about their life and help prepare them for their trip
> into the Lands of the Dead. Record their thoughts, fears, dreams and
> hopes in your journal for posterity. 

Orchard put this in a category of _solo journaling games_. Considering
myself a connoisseur of good narrative and a halfway decent writer,
this might be a way to cut down on screen time and exercise the
creative muscles.

Here’s a quick Kagi search discovery for [a definition from Tina
Alberion][3]

> Solo journaling games are incredibly diverse, but their unifying
> elements are prompts and recording/documenting. Many solo journaling
> games allow the player to determine their journaling method. Some

And [a deeper dive][4] from Jordan Rocke

> What is a Solo Journaling TTRPG?

> OK, so what are they? Basically, it’s a sub-genre of TableTop Role
> Playing Games (like Dungeons & Dragons, etc). TTRPGs are games where
> you tell a story with some friends, using some external element to
> determine how successful you are at doing what your character wants
> to do. That’s normally dice, but coins, playing cards, tarot cards
> and other elements are slowly entering the field. 

> The issue with games like Dungeons & Dragons, and basically all the
> other big name RPG systems, is that they only function as
> multiplayer games. Clearly, as being an adult is scheduling hell, a
> lot of people hit the point where they wanted to try playing games
> that weren’t reliant on a group of busy people finding time and
> energy to play. Enter solo TTRPGs! ... 

> Instead, let me try to sell you specifically on solo journaling
> RPGs! The premise is simple: you are writing an account of your
> experiences from the perspective of a fictional character. The
> normal format is that you are given a prompt, and have to write a
> short (or sometimes long) passage to respond to it. The line between
> TTRPG and creative writing exercise is a little murky, but it’s fun
> all the same. The specific ways these games work varies A LOT, and
> it’s a little difficult to actually summarise in any way that covers
> all solo journaling RPGs. So, let me take you through some of the
> games I’ve tried, and maybe you’ll see something interesting! 

I think I’ve found a new rabbit hole to fall into.
