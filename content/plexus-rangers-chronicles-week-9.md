Brutality abounded in multiple ways:

* The opponent, in the league's last position, was 1 and 7 entering play.
* I had a great matchup with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers going against the San Diego Chargers. Problem was the other side had Philip Rivers **and** Vincent Jackson. Rodgers gave me 30 points, but Rivers, despite two pick-sixes, and Jackson teamed up for 66+.
* Miles Austin pulled a hamstring in the first half. Thanks for the 6 points buddy.
* For the second time this season, I played a defense that went for negative points. 7 players versus 8 is a tough get.
* I knew I had lost by the end of the 4 PM games. I was down 7 points, and the opponent still had **two** players left to go. So I lost 7 versus 6.
* The final killer, I had Julio Jones and DeMarco Murray on the bench leading to a net of about 28 points wasted. I didn't start Murray because I didn't want to go with 3 Cowboys on my roster. But I didn't really consider benching Austin for Jones and playing Murray. **Duh!**

I'm in 7th out of 8 teams, with 5 games to play. Every opponent this year has scored 100+ fantasy points against me. I lead the league on Points Against by 130+. A player in my starting lineup has gotten injured each week. This just might not be my year.
