![Xonsh Terminal Screen Capture]({static}/images/xonsh_capture.png)

Been having some fun reworking my terminal and shell setup based upon
[xonsh][1]. I’m quite proud of myself for getting the 🐚 emoji into my
prompt, which was decidedly trickier than I expected. Console is
[iTerm2][4]. Glyphs and icons via [Nerd Fonts][3]. The system info was
generated by [neofetch][2]
