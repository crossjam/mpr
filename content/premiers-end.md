There are pretty much three races. Man City vs Man U for the title. Arsenal, Tottenham, and Newcastle United for the third and fourth positions, with at least one making the next Champion’s League. And finally Bolton Wanderers and Queens Park Rangers are trying to avoid relegation.

I like how the Premiership schedules their last weekend. Everyone plays and every game starts at the same time. No team sits in their locker room, rooting for an outcome. If you need a result, all you can do is your part.

Still got it in my gut that something wacky is going to happen at the top. Maybe Rangers pull a draw against The Citizens or the Red Devils actually lose to clinch it for Man City anyway. It would only be fitting if all three races were still in doubt going into the second half of the matches.
