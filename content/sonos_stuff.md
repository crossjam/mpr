I have four Sonos speakers and generally enjoy them. They make
streaming audio from my ripped files and from Internet services easy
and pleasant. The speakers were acquired a few years ago when Sonos
supported [last.fm](https://last.fm) scrobbling (tracing music plays).

Suffice it to say, Sonos has had [a quite bad sequence of quarters][3]
from the software development perspective. Not much impact on me
really. Apple Music playlist scanning has been crappy for a few years
now, and since Sonos seems to rely on an outdated way to get access to
that data, I’m not holding my breath. But then [Sonos support for
last.fm integration bit the dust][4].

So I’m looking forward to trying `sonos-lastfm` to see if it actually
works. Even if not, SoCo looks like fun just for messing around with
my speakers from Python. There’s also dreams of doing my own playlist
management and getting back to the nirvana of "album shuffle" that was
once an iTunes feature.

Here’s the kicker. **My** last.fm integration still seems to be
working for some mysterious reason. I’m sure it’ll go poof the minute
I attempt to reconfigure the speakers or tweak the service. And it has
been occasionally missing some scrobbles if I don’t have the Sonos
desktop app running on a machine somewhere. Whatevs.
