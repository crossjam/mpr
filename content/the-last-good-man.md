Fuck it. I usually don't bite on books from [John Scalzi's *Big Idea* series][1], but with a co-plug from Charles Stross I’ll take a chance on Linda Nagata’s [*The Last Good Man*][3].

From [the pitch][2]:
> Of course there is a lot more going on in this novel. The Last Good Man is a fast-paced, high-tech, military thriller that deals with autonomous weapons, big data, A.I., surveillance, remote warfare—and their effects on human relationships. But from the first day that the story truly started to take shape, I knew it would be centered on a woman. Specifically, True Brighton, retired US Army soldier, former helicopter pilot with frontline experience, a forty-nine-year-old mother of three who’s been happily married for three decades, and who is not at all ready to retire.

This speaks to me on so many levels, can’t wait to give it a read.
