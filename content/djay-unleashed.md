If I read [this][1] right, [a vexing problem][2] I had with [djay][3] as virtual turntables has been solved:
>  There are actually two points here. You have the ability to support multichannel audio interfaces in djay, previously unavailable, and you also can route headphone output and main output separately – so even without a multichannel interface, you could use, say, both the headphone jack and an HDMI or USB out. That’s a big deal for DJs, because finally, you can pre-cue tracks, but also should mean apps with multichannel recording and playback, other tools with separate cueuing, and, heck, even iPad-based surround rigs if you want them

Will have to rekick the tires.
