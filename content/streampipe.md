TIL [Steampipe][1]. From [the intro announcement][2]:

> Steampipe, a new open source project from Turbot, enables cloud pros
> (e.g. software developers, operations engineers and security teams)
> to query their favorite cloud services with SQL. It has quickly
> become one of our favorite tools in-house and we hope it finds a way
> into your tool box as well.

> The heart of Steampipe is an intuitive command line interface (CLI)
> that solves the challenges encountered when asking questions of
> cloud resources and services. Traditional tools and custom scripts
> that provide visibility into these services are cumbersome,
> inconsistent across providers and painful to maintain. Steampipe
> provides a consistent, explorable and interactive approach across
> IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services.
