Great night of playoff action in the NBA and NHL:

* LeBron James and [the Cavaliers tee off on the Celtics][2] and blow them out in Game 3 on the parquet floor.

* Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers tied at 3 well into the third period. The Broad Street Bullies trying desperately to avoid the sweep and stay alive.

* Los Suns, surprisingly solid in the half-court and leading 2-0, visit San Antonio in the second half of the NBA doubleheader. *Good on Los Suns for standing up a little against Arizona's ill-devised immigration laws.*

* And Chicago resumes its battle with the Vancouver Canucks to round out the NHL twinbill.

Bonus action: Yankees vs Rd Sox, and the Nationals playing halfway decent against the Marlins.
