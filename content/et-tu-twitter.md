So now Twitter has joined Facebook in [bombarding my inbox][1] with useless notices about people I already track. Frankly, my email has pretty much become a cesspool of solicitation from corporate entities that I’ve had a prior “relationship” with. I’m almost surprised when I receive a human generated message directly for me.  It’s just about enough to make an old UNIXhead give up the darn medium.

Time to go on a filtering rampage.
