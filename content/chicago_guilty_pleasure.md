It's sort of hard to call an Academy Award Best Picture winner a guilty pleasure, but I seem to remember a bit of a kerfluffle given the competition that year: [*The Pianist*][5], [*The Hours*][3], [*The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*][4], and [*Gangs of New York*][2]. You could make an argument that [*Chicago*][1] is the lightweight of the bunch. But this one is a must stop when I come across it on cable.

Things I really like about the movie:

* *Chicago*, while being a musical also imparts a sense of being *at* the theater.

* Love the music, especially *And All That Jazz*, *Nowadays*, *We Both Reached for the Gun*, and *Razzle Dazzle*.

* A fun cast, including Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly.

* The *Cell Block Tango* is probably the best dance number, a great song, and the ladies are easy on the eyes.

* Love the rousing closing sequence of *Nowadays*, *All That Jazz*, the audience cheering and then into the credits.

* It's **Chicago**!

See, my guilty pleasures aren't all about cars and/or Jason Statham.
