Wondering how hard it would be to build a good set of autodidact materials  for learning probability and statistics similar to [*Think Stats*][1] and [*Baseball Hacks*][5]. The twist would be to use sports repositories ala [Retrosheet][2], cleanly integrated into [pandas][3] for analysis *(bonus points for [iPython HTML notebook][4] usage)*, and then have a follow up course on building data oriented, interactive web sites. 

Might be a market for that.
