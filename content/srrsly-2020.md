Personally, 2019 was a real struggle of a year for me. But 2020 is flat godawful from a global societal perspective. And we haven’t even quite hit mf’in June yet!

The fact that the President of the United States was impeached for only the third time in the country’s history will probably be a footnote in this year’s historical record. Back to Normal (TM) is oxymoronic. This is your normal. Best be about making it better, and quick.

More technical and entertainment shenanigans are forthcoming. But a facade of “This is Fine” would be irresponsible. Had to uncork a little and at least acknowledge the turmoil.
