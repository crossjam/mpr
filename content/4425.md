[*Operating System Implications of Fast, Cheap, Non-Volatile Memory*][2]

>  The existence of two basic levels of storage (fast/volatile and slow/non-volatile) has been a long-standing premise of most computer systems, influencing the design of OS components, including file systems, virtual memory, scheduling, execution models, and even their APIs. Emerging resistive memory technologies – such as phase-change memory (PCM) and memristors – have the potential to provide large, fast, non-volatile memory systems, changing the assumptions that motivated the design of current operating systems. This paper examines the implications of non-volatile memories on a number of OS mechanisms, functions, and properties.

Starting to think **UltraRAM** rolls off the tongue better than my [tongue in cheek moniker BigRAM][1]. Besides being cheap enough to splurge on, RAM will be different in the future.
