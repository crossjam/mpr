Can’t believe I’ve never posted about [GH Archive][1]

There’s a solid 10+ years of freely available GitHub spewed JSON to
practice data spelunking, system benchmarking, and query hacking
against.

**Update**: The [CNCF DevStats project][2] puts that data to
interesting use through application of actual CNCF projects. So meta!

_At least Google couldn’t find any such post on my site. Maybe that’s
a hint to implement some real local search._ 🤣
