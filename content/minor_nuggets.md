[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Launchbar Logo.jpg" alt="Launchbar Logo.jpg" border="0" width="64" height="64" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][4] I find myself using LaunchBar much more for search queries and opening URLs. And when I do I often TAB select my way into using Chrome. Might be time to switch my default browser. And who needs [Choosy](http://www.choosyosx.com)?

Macworld's [review of LaunchBar 5.0.2][2] gets to the heart of my favorite launcher. Mind the user reviews as well. I'm also using LaunchBar's clipboard history features more and more.

[Thunderbird 3.1 Beta][5] seems to be working out well so far. [Dock icon madness][6] may have been solved.

I really like Robert Hodgins' [*Hello, Cinder*][1] introduction to programming with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/). Makes [particle systems][3] in C++ seem damn easy.
