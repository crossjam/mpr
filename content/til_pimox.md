[Proxmox VE][2] is the thrifty persons VMWare ESXi or an ops-limited persons
OpenStack. I’ve definitely enjoyed it at work for managing VMs on just
a single node. There’s a stack of RPi 3s on my desk where pimox would
be applicable.

Pimox installation doesn’t look to be easy peasy, but at least a
manageable, cuddly afternoon with the CLI.
