I managed to spark the reading passion once again. First, in January I just
picked up the copy of William Gibson’s _Agency_ that had been sitting
unread on my bookshelf for months, and started reading. Second, I gave
in and began reading books in the Amazon Kindle app on my
iPhone. Don’t know what it is, but for some reason that used to feel
_tawdry_. But the best book to read now is the one immediately at
hand.

In any event, for recording purposes, here’s the year’s tally so far,
in no particular order

* [_Agency_][1], William Gibson
* [_All Tommorow’s Parties_][2], William Gibson
* [_Soccernomics_][3], Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski
* [_The Collapsing Empire_][4], John Scalzi
* [_Essentialism_][5], Greg McKeown
* [_Working Backwards_][6], Colin Bryar and Bill Carr
* [_Stories of Your Life and Others_][7], Ted Chiang

I don’t have a particular urge to start doing reviews, but all were
enjoyable. _Essentialism_ was a little fluffy, but I align with its
sentiments. 

In the meantime, there’s a nice stack of physical books in the
backlog, not to mention a healthy lineup of ebooks ready for the
Kindle app. We’ll see how long this holds and how many I knock out in
2021.
