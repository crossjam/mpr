I have to say, for the longest time I had my aggregator pointed at [Douglas Rushkoff][1] but wasn't getting much out of his blog. He wrote [*Life Inc.*][2] which seemed intriguing, but wasn't high on my list of things to pay attention to.

Then he started making various [television appearances][7], posting short [*Life Inc.* Dispatch videos][3], and writing for a number of different online sites ([Edge][4], [Arthur][5], [The Daily Beast][6]). For whatever the reason, my antenna perked up and I've been sympathizing with his general themes. Think I'll have to pick up *Life. Inc.*
