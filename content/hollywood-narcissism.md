Well, Walter Jon Williams [*The Fourth Wall*][1] wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. Our intrepid heroine Dagmar is replaced as primary “protagonist” by Sean Makin. I use protagonist loosely as Makin is a stupefyingly self-absorbed former child acting star. The narrative devolves into a murder mystery regarding the Hollywood-based transmedia production Dagmar is helming with Makin in the lead role.

I think Williams was trying to explore the intersection of mass global entertainment and technology, but there wasn’t enough tech for me. And Makin is not a particularly good person but we have to spend 90% of the book locked into his inner dialogue.

Might be time to retire Dagmar and her crew.
