P. Taylor Goetz, one of the project leads, is doing [an overview of Storm][2] in concert with the 1.0 release.
> In this series of blog posts, we will provide an in-depth look select features introduced with the release of Apache Storm (Storm) 1.0. To kick off the series, we’ll take a look how Storm has evolved over the years from its beginnings as an open source project, up to the 1.0 milestone release.

The space of computing over and developing against streaming data has grown crowded in the past year or two. Storm is one of those technologies good to know about as it provides a useful baseline of features to discuss and has significant “burn in”. And it’s still getting better!
