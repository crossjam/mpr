Completed [Nnedi Okorafor’s novella *Binti*][1] today. Okorafor writes from an African perspective making Binti’s tale distinctive from the average fare. There are exquisite moments of self-discovery, tension, and terror. I empathized a lot from my own personal experience. And like a lot of good science fiction, the story says a lot more about The Now than The Future. 

I also appreciated that there wasn’t a big reveal or shock ending. I was tensing up for a moment, but breathed easy after completing the final page.

Definitely recommended. A tight, efficient journey to other places that is well worth your time.
