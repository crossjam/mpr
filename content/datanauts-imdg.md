Been listening to a few episodes of the [Datanauts podcast][2], and [as I anticipated][7], the material is right up my alley. Actually, the hosts [Ethan][4] C. [Banks][5] and [Chris Wahl][3] really impressed me in [a discussion][1] of [Apache Geode][6], an in-memory data grid (IMDG). While Banks and Wahl clearly aren’t distributed systems researchers / hackers, they asked exceptionally good, fundamental questions about how Geode fares under various conditions (e.g, network partitions). 

So far, so good. I can recommend a subscription in your podcatcher to the Datanauts.
