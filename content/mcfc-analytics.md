Link parkin’: [Manchester City Football Club Analytics][1]. An open invitation to hack with football data from **every** game of the 2011-2012 Barclay’s Premier League season, not just Man City, or at least that’s how I read the announcement.
> You have a unique opportunity to be part of this community.  Register your interest in this project and we will send you our OPTA data set for every ‘on the ball’ event for every Premier League player in every match in the entire 2011-12 Premier League season FOR FREE.

> This data is designed to be broken down, analysed, graphed and visualised however you see fit.  We have made it available to encourage and inspire the next level of analytics.  Our hope is that the data is used to create new performance measures, tools for player/team comparison and profiling, season-long analysis for benchmarking players’ performance and contextualising these performances based on playing position and opposition.

The Noisy Neighbors just made my 2012-2013 Premier League rooting decision for me. I’m all on City’s bandwagon for this campaign. Hope they can pull off the back-to-back. And do a little better in the Champions League. 

At the very least, this squad has a bit of ... “personality”.
