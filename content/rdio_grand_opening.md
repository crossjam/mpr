The company's blog has [some of the product details][3] including:<em>

* Select any and all of our seven million songs and play them, on-demand, as much as you want.

* Sync as many songs as you can fit on your phone, and play them even when you’re offline (and of course, play everything when you’re online).

* Follow friends to find new music, rather than staring at an empty search box

* Find friends from Twitter, Facebook and email

* Discover music in industry insiders’ Collections and Playlists, such as Spin Magazine, Pitchfork, KCRW Radio, The FADER and XLR8R Magazine

</em>

Not sure I'll be into all the social features, but having a huge music library accessible from an iPod Touch is enticing.

Reminds me that I should check out [last.fm's](http://last.fm) iPod Touch client, if it exists.
