As the year winds down I’ve been looking at some of my older MPR content. One noticeable difference is the amount of original content. Definitely has decreased over time. There’s been a discernible increase in embeds and pull quotes, probably correlating to increased posting from iOS devices.

Something to think about going into next year. On the one hand quoting and linking makes it easier to post consistently. On the other, I’d really rather not publish a link blog although I could be accused of doing that already.
