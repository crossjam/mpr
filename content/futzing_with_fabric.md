Title: Futzing With Fabric
Status: published
Date: 2023-08-03

Previously, I claimed to have ["finished fabric"][1]. That was just
gathering the bits. But then there’s actually getting all that music
into the macOS Music app. Le Sigh!

A couple of weeks ago I started reconciling the release lists with the
playlists in my Music app. Turns out I actually didn’t have one
release [(Fabric Live 34, Krafty Kuts)][2] and hadn’t really finished
Fabric. I had been exchanging with the Fabric team for bulk digital
downloads and Krafty Kuts accidentally got subbed with another mix.

Thankfully, [Fabric First][3] digital members now have access to
**all** of the releases. So problem solved. _P. S. for the quarterly
cost of digital membership, you get incredible value. Even if you
can’t get to the club._

And then there’s the metadata issue. Music Brainz Picard is a godsend
for fixing local file metadata. All I’ll say is that getting iCloud Music
Library to sync with that metadata is a bear. I get really annoyed
with missing metadata because Fabric has great cover art.

After a whole bunch of futzing, I think I’ve finally got it nailed,
but maybe it’s time for some automation to nail a confirmation. Even
at this state, I find the odd omission in a playlist and metadata
hasn’t tracked all devices. Thanks Apple!
