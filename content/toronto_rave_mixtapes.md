Often they tweet links to appearance announcements, new releases, and interesting older material.

Thanks to a DJ Heather [tweet][4], I found out about the [Toronto Rave Mixtape Archive](http://www.torontoravemixtapearchive.com/). Within that site there's a large collection of [house music mixes from the mid-90's][1]. Names of interest include Pierre, Derrick Carter, Juan Atkins, DJ Dan, Doc Martin, and Bad Boy Bill.
