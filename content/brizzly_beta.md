[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Brizzly Mascot.png" alt="Brizzly Mascot.png" border="0" width="112" height="135" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Don't know if it was the luck of the draw, or just my turn in the queue, but I got an invite code for [Brizzly][1].

Brizzly mainly appears to be an alternative web interface for Twitter. At least for my tweet stream, there seems to be minimal difference from the Twitter view. In Brizzly, [Twitpic][3] images are expanded inline. Similarly for shortened URLs. Other than that I'm not seeing a whole lot.

The [Brizzly help page][2] does have some more feature info though. I should give it an extended test drive.

Don't know why, but the Brizzly mascot makes me a bit uncomfortable. Maybe bears shouldn't wear spandex that tightly. *And you know it's spandex of course!*

Brizzly, brought to you by [thing labs](http://www.thinglabs.com/) has a [blog][4] and there's [more info from UsefulTools][5].
