Title: Adopting Atuin

For the longest time, like a decade or more, I’ve been really
irritated by the behavior of the bash C-r key binding. It’s supposed
to be a reverse history search by default. It has some [non-obvious
behavior][2] though if you decide you’ve gone too far in your
history. 

The fix to bash is probably straightforward and I could have got on
with my life. But sometimes I’m a dope. Anyway, I’m retooling my shell
life, prompted by this Frank Wiles’ post [_My CLI World_][3]

Enter [atuin][1]:

Yeah, atuin is what I needed. And being the dope I am, I’ve known
about it for a while now. The cross-host synching seems cools, but the
default synch server being someone else’s host put me off a
little. 

The initial experience is looking great and exceeding my
expectations. 

Yup. I really am a dope. Onwards to integrating [direnv][4] and [zoxide][5].
