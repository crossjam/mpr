That's what happens when you only score three points for the second week in a row. USC just [laid the beatdown][1] on the poor Bears this past Saturday.

Things don't get any easier either, with a road game at UCLA. The Bruins are half decent this year.

Given that the potential to shutdown Jahvid Best has been definitively demonstrated, the Bears just need to find something upon which they can build. Simply being productive on offense next week would be a step forward.

Jiminy! They'll probably be underdogs for [The Big Game][2]. That's looking like our bowl game for this year.
