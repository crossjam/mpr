**Shuffle Switching**. I'm a playlist guy, and most of my playlists aren't useful shuffled, as they're for dj mixed CDs. However, I have one playlist that's a bunch of singles, specifically designed for shuffling. Unlike iTunes playlists, apparently iPod playlists can't be marked individually for shuffling.

However, selecting a track and then hitting the Nano center button a few times allows you to quickly switch the Nano's current shuffle state. So the procedure is pick a track in a playlist, start it playing, then set the shuffle state with a couple of clicks. No muss, no fuss.

**Scrolling Long Titles**. The Mini would horizontally scroll long track titles, but not long album names, artist names, or playlist names. Irritating.

The Nano corrects this deficiency.

That is all.
