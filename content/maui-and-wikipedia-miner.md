[maui][1]:
> *Maui automatically identifies main topics in text documents. Depending on the task, topics are tags, keywords, keyphrases, vocabulary terms, descriptors, index terms or titles of Wikipedia articles.*

[Wikipedia Miner][2]:
> *WikipediaMiner is a toolkit for tapping the rich semantics encoded within Wikipedia.*

> *It makes it easy to integrate Wikipedia's knowledge into your own applications, by:*

> * *providing simplified, object-oriented access to Wikipedia's structure and content.*
> * *measuring how terms and concepts in Wikipedia are connected to each other.*
> * *detecting and disambiguating Wikipedia topics when they are mentioned in documents.*

**Bonus**, [Chromium Compact Language Detector][3]:
> *Wonderfully, Google has open-sourced most of Chrome's source code, including the embedded CLD (Compact Language Detector) library that's used to detect the language of any UTF-8 encoded content.   It looks like CLD was extracted from the language detection library used in Google's toolbar.*

> *It turns out the CLD part of the Chromium source tree is nicely standalone, so I pulled it out into a new separate Google code project, making it possible to use CLD directly from any C++ code.*
