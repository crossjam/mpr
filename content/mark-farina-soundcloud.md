Right now, I only listen to about 4-5 playlists on a regular basis. There might be another 10 (and that's being generous) that I listen to occasionally. Finding good mixes on the Amazon MP3 or iTunes Music stores is getting more difficult.If I can get up to speed on iTunes’ Smart Playlists, I'll dump many of my regular playlists off of the iPhone. Then I'd really like to dial into some house, DnB, and other electronic music podcasts and downloads. Thanks to [Tweetbot][3], I'm seeing a number of podcast retweets in my Twitter stream.

For example, [DJ Mark Farina][2] recently wiped out his [SoundCloud page][1] and then uploaded a boat load of material. I've probably downloaded a bunch in previous incarnations but maybe these are cleaner or higher resolution. Almost definitely a few I haven't downloaded.

Time to get some inflow from the magnificently wider world.
