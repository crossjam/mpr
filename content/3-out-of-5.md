Ernie Grunfeld started to evoke my worst fears with NBA trade deadline moves.  Thankfully, he actually achieved two of [my higher priority desires][3] for the Wizards. [Javale McGee and Nick Young are no longer with the team][2].

Let me say that again. [**NICK YOUNG AND JAVALE MCGEE ARE NO LONGER WASHINGTON WIZARDS!!**][1] With Flip Saunders fired, that makes for 3 of my 5 wishes. Even so, Young pulled a dick move, rejecting a trade to Denver and forcing a landing in Los Angeles. Good luck getting signed next year bub.

Now Ernie did saddle the franchise with the contract of NeNe, which has 4 years at $13 million per left to go, a guy who has difficulty staying healthy. Still just getting rid of two **clowns** who constantly wind up on viral YouTube videos for the wrong reason, and get openly mocked and laughed at on SportsCenter is a good thing.

Also, I didn't know Ernie's contract expires this summer. Depending on whether that's before or after the NBA draft, Ted Leonsis can just wait him out and gracefully bring in someone new. While I thank Ernie for today's service, he's still a central part of the problem. His removal is part 4 of my wishes.

Too bad he couldn't move Aundray Blatche, the fifth and final piece of the puzzle, but hey, baby steps. And *(mouth watering)* there's always that veteran amnesty slot.
