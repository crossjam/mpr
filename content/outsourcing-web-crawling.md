Men who wrote hairy systems code that optimized DNS queries, tweaked operating system TCP kernel options, avoided robot traps, and honored complex, dynamic revisit schedules.

Nowadays, thanks to [80legs][1], you can [fork over 99 bucks a month][2], setup 3 crawl jobs, repeating if you like, and get the contents of a million URLs. All from the comfort of your own home.

This is progress.
