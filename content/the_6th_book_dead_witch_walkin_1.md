I could not *stand* Kim Harrison's [*Dead Witch Walking*][1].

[*Dead Witch Walking*][1] is rightfully categorized as "[urban fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)." Unfortunately that label applies to two wildly different strains of storytelling.

On the one hand, you have writers like [Kim Harrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Harrison), [Laurell K. Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurell_K._Hamilton), and [Patricia Briggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Briggs). You might call these authors descendants of Anne Rice, blending the supernatural, horror, and romance.

On the other hand, you've got [Neil Gaiman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman), [Cory Doctorow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_doctorow) (at least for [*Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town*][2]), and [Emma Bull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Bull). The intersection of the urban and the fantastic is the central focus. The romance is secondary or non-existent.

I'm a fan of the latter camp. Trying to extend my canon, I foraged on Amazon, came up with [*Dead Witch Walking*][1], and wound up in the former camp. I did not enjoy the experience.

Rachel Morgan, the heroine of the story, is a supernatural bounty hunter. She practices her trade in Cincinnati, Ohio. A fictional area known as "The Hollows", just across the river from Cincinnati, houses various fantastic sorts such as vampires, pixies, and demons. At the start of [*Dead Witch Walking*][1], Morgan works for a big, soul sucking, bureaucratic organization. In the process of quitting and starting her independent agency, she becomes a marked woman. Solving the mystery of who's after her and why takes up the bulk of the book.

In regards to the writing, I had two major beefs with [*Dead Witch Walking*][1]. First, there are a number of points where sexual tension is built up, but not resolved. I don't need a tell all porn show, but no satisfaction is just irritating. Even the resolution of the main mystery left me wanting. Second, the world of The Hollows just didn't project a satisfying, internal consistency. Maybe I need to be better educated about the mythos that Harrison was leveraging, but there were many elements of the fantastical milieu that left me going, "Hunh? Why?"

In the end, I don't want to disparage Harrison's abilities as an author. Clearly, she resonates with many people she is making quite happy. As for me, [*Dead Witch Walking*][1] was easily my worst read of 2008. Just not my cup of tea.
