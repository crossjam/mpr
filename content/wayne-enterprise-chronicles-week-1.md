There was some nervousness when Arian Foster reported a knee injury at the tail of the week and was something of game time decision. Shades of CJ2K biting me in the rear two years ago. But Foster gave me a solid 20 points with a surprising 18 from Darren McFadden.

My starting receivers, Hakeem Nicks and Marques Colston were disappointing with less than 10 points each. Cam Newton came up well under his projected as well. In contrast, I had Tony Romo and Miles Austin had big games. Cam probably gets another week, but I’m sorely tempted to plug in Austin.

Whatever. My team put won handily, although I had to wait until late Monday night to really feel comfortable.
