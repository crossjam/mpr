Title: Python CLI Authentication

My default starting point for building a new piece of software is to
create a command line interface (CLI) app. I’ve even got [my own
personalized Python cookiecutter template][2] to generate them
quickly. Independent of some personal preferences that this supports,
like options for logging, thanks to the [click][4] argument parsing
toollkit, the autogenerated tool immediately integrates well with the
wider UNIX ecosystem.

Buuuut, I’ve never gotten a good handle on how to integrate this
approach with the modern Web API OAuth+API token
methodology. [OAuth][5] gives me a headache 😆.

I’m still digesting this article from the folks at
[notia.ai](https://notia.ai), entitled ["Building an authenticated
Python CLI,"][1] but on first read it seems really well done.

>  When building out the Notia client, we found a real lack of
>  resources around building a persistently authenticated Python
>  library.


> To address this, we are going to be building an interactive,
> authenticated Python CLI that uses the Twitter API to fetch the top
> Machine Learning tweets of the week! You can see the final result in
> the video demo above - or you can skip to the final code here.


> Building this CLI will let us explore concepts like authenticating a
> local device between uses, accepting CLI arguments with Click, and
> displaying our data interactively with Rich. 

I’ll definitely be taking their advice in building some future
X-to-sqlite applications.

cookiecutter template._
