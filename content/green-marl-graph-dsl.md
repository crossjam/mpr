Let’s try out this here newfangled tweet [embedding][1] in WordPress:

Just the link on a line by itself isn’t quite working for me. However, The `embed` shortcode seems to do the trick. 

This is fabulous!! Definitely handy for spicing up this space visually.

And a quote for old time’s sake:
> The increasing importance of graph-data based applications is fueling the need for highly efficient and parallel implementations of graph analysis software. In this paper we describe Green-Marl, a domain-specific language (DSL) whose high level language constructs allow developers to describe their graph analysis algorithms intuitively, but expose the data-level parallelism inherent in the algorithms.
