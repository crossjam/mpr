Once again, shout out to all GReader staff past and present for delivering a ton of value for nothing out of my pocket. No heapings of scorn from this quarter. Execs made a business decision and I wasn’t exactly a paying customer. It was a good run while it lasted. Special kudos to Mihai Parparita for [whipping together][2] the eminently useful [readerisdead toolkit][3] on short notice. Somehow it successfully slurped down *multiple gigabytes* of Reader data for me across multiple accounts.

Moving onward! I’ve decided to go with [feedbin.me][4] since it’s [approved for use with Mr. Reader][5]. I realized that despite [my affection for NetNewsWire][6], I now do the vast majority of my feedreading on my iPad, either on the couch or interstitially. So tilting towards my favorite reader there means the least dislocation. Meanwhile, Marco Arment somewhat [put a stake in the prospects of NetNwsWire][7]. To compensate on the desktop, I’m adding [ReadKit][8] to the mix.

However, [like dangerousmeta][9], I waited until the last minute to make up my mind. I’m reserving the right to radically change my mind as I see fit.
