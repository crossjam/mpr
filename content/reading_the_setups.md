The number of entries went way back. All the way back to [Alex Payne][3], presumably the first entry.

So I decided to read them all.

Don't know if this is just selection bias, but I noticed there were quite a few Macs in usage, maybe even a significant majority. A lot were laptops with only 4GB of memory. Also enjoyed the gender mix and the eclectic "career" choices.

Some of the more entertaining entries for me included: [Amy Hoy][4], [Aaron Swartz][5], [Richard Stallman][6], [Mark Pilgrim][7], [Anne Halsall][8] *(reminds me I need to checkout Inkling)*, and [Andrew "bunnie" Huang][9],
