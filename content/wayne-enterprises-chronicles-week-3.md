That’s 3 and 0 for those counting at home. Leading the league at this moment, although as in all things fantasy, my luck could turn at any minute.

The big surprises this week were Darren McFadden with 18.5 points and Tony Gonzalez with 19.6 points. Great production out of RB2 and the TE position. McFadden scored more than Arian Foster *(!)* my, and the league’s, overall number one pick. Both my wide receivers were solid with double digit performances and even K Robbie Gould pitched in with 13 points. 

I had a comfortable enough lead going into the Sunday night game, that I could even leave the Ravens DEF in against the New England offense. Luckily they didn’t go negative or I really would have been sweating. Serious consideration was given to benching the Ravens.

102 points without much production from a key position, QB, just shows the strength of this team. And Cam Newton might get benched for RGIII this weekend!
