He recently completed his O’Reilly book, [“Designing Data-Intensive Applications.”][1]

> As software engineers, we need to build applications that are reliable, scalable and maintainable in the long run. We need to understand the range of available tools and their trade-offs. For that, we have to dig deeper than buzzwords.

> This book will help you navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for storing and processing data. We compare a broad variety of tools and approaches, so that you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each, and decide what’s best for your application.

I read the first couple of chapters from the early release edition, but haven’t been tracking the book to its completion. Based upon the quality of [his blog posts][3] *(really enjoyed the post on [techniques for real-time text search][2])*, I’m looking forward to catching up with the final product.

Also interesting to see Kleppmann joined the University of Cambridge as a Research Associate, working on the [TRVE DATA][5] project.
