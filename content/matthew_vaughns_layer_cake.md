Just a quickie for the holiday. I'd also parked Matthew Vaughn's [*Layer Cake*][1] on the DVR and just got around to watching the flick. Another well done British crime thriller from the same producer *(not director)* of [*Snatch*][2], although not nearly as frenetic or comedic.

*Layer Cake* makes up for it though by being slightly more probing of British class dynamics and having a few more surprises up its sleeve. Also, the Sienna Miller/Daniel Craig relationship has some real sparks. Very judiciously applied, I'm torn as to whether a little more of those two together would have made for a better film.

There's something about the modern Brit gangster flick that's definitely missing in today's American cinema. It's almost as if [*Goodfellas*][3] pretty much closed the book on stylish gangster tales for this side of the pond. In light of my string of recent discoveries, I'm wondering if there isn't a whole lot more where *Snatch*, [*RocknRolla*][4], and *Layer Cake* came from.

**Update**. Somewhat formulaic, but an interesting [backgrounder on *Layer Cake*][5] from celebritywonder.com.
