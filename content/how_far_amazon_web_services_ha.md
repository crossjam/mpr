[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/AWS Logo.gif" alt="AWS Logo.gif" border="0" width="164" height="60" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][3] In a former life, I made a [prediction][1] about Amazon putting together computation, messaging and storage in a utility pricing framework. This was before [Amazon EC2][4], and [Amazon Web Services][3] more generally, [came into being][5]. My prediction, if not dead on, was pretty accurate.

At that time, it was a little unclear what the impact of Amazon's offerings would be. A little less than four years later and now the [White House is deploying systems][2] to EC2. And it's not just some piddly site, but [Recovery.gov](http://recovery.gov). Not to mention there's now a whole "cloud computing" industry in which EC2 is the standard bearer.

To this day, I still think EC2 is one of the coolest things to happen in computing in a long time. *We overestimate the impact of change in the short run, and underestimate the impact in the long run.*
