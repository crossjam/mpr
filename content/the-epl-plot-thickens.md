In [an interesting mid-week set of matches][1], Wigan Athletic beat Manchester United, 1-0. Meanwhile, Manchester City rolled on West Bromich, 4-0, putting The Citizens 5 points back with 5 to play. Plus, there's still another leg of the Manchester Derby at the Etihads, where City could conceivably pick up 3 points. Definitely appointment viewing for that match. One more toestub by ManU and things get really interesting.

Arsenal also continued their incredible revival, squashing Wolves 3-0. The Gunners are close to locking up 3rd and Wolverhampton close to locking up relegation.
