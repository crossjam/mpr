I'm slowly easing back into exercising and spent a 1/2 hour on the stationary bike today. Great opportunity to put the Kindle to use, and I did so knocking out about half of Niall O'Higgins' [*Mongo DB & Python*][1]. Very productive use of my time.

At 50 printed pages, it's a slim tome, but O'Higgins so far has done two things really well. First, in about two or three pages he succinctly summarizes the differences between [MongoDB][2] and typical RDBMS systems. Frankly I found [10Gen's][3] documentation to be pretty poor in this regard. Second, some time is spent on the MongoDB operators that can atomically mutate embedded documents. This is somewhat the equivalent of [Redis'][4] atomic data structures, although not quite as clean in my opinion. Take that with a boulder of salt as I've used neither MongoDB nor Redis for even minor experiments much less in production. The key point is that I learned MongoDB is somewhat closer to Redis than I thought.

At $19.99 *MongoDB & Python* seems a bit pricey for the page count, but I bought the e-book version, which is cheaper, and got a half off deal. So I only wound up paying $8 which is quite is reasonable.

**Apropos of nothing.** My Kindle is showing some cracks in the casing. It's less than a year old! Then again, My Little Guy(™) has gotten a hold of it a few times.
