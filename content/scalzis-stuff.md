John Scalzi is [one of my favorite authors][3]. Recently visiting the DC metro area, he had a mental slip and [lost track of his computer bag][2]. 

I’m glad to say the DC area came through, [returning the bag][1], and full contents, to him. Good on ya’ DMV, there’s gotta be a karma bonus in there somewhere.
