So why did I put [so much effort][3] into getting Pygame, Numpy, and Pycairo into the same Python interpreter? I'm interested in creating [demoscene][2] like visualizations. [luis2048's][4] processing [final project][1] is an example of the type of generative art I want to experiment with.

Clearly this could be done with [processing](http://processing.org) but I feel like that tool's image processing capabilities are limited. By that I mean there isn't much domain specific language or library in processing related to bit level image manipulation. I'm curious as to what might go into a good language for writing these visualizations. [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org) should provide a solid foundation for image processing abstracting much of the array processing hair.

Also, I'd rather use Python than Java. I think Python has some built-in data structures and modules that might be particularly useful.

So that's what I'm puttering and nattering on about.
