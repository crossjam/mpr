I'm not a Will Ferrel fan.

Sascha Baren Cohen is overrated.

I still love [*Talladega Nights, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby*][1]. The movie never fails to get me to chortle out loud. Maybe it's because of:

* John C. Reilly as Cal Naughton Jr. a.k.a. Mike Honcho.

* OK, Cohen is overrated, but Jean Girard is pretty damn funny. *Hakuna matata, bitches!*. *You spilled my macchiato!*

* Leslie Bibb as Carley Bobby is quite easy on the eyes.  Then you throw in Amy Adams for good measure.

*  The all-star comedy cast. When you're giving Molly Shannon and Andy Richter bit parts, you know you've overprovisioned the talent.

* #1 reason, Walker (*Greatest Generation my ass. Tom Brokaw's a punk!*) and Texas Ranger (*Chip, I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!*) at the dinner table.

* Oh hell, the whole damn dinner scene: *"I like to think of Jesus as a mischievous badger."* "If we wanted two wussies, we would have named them Dr. Quinn and Medicine Woman!" *"I like to think of Jesus as an Ice Dancer, dressed in an all-white jumpsuit, and doing an interpretive dance of my life."*

If you ain't first, you're last. Boy did Ferrel fall off after this one.

*Talladega Nights* isn't sophisticated, but at least it's not gross, moves fast, and there's actually some sly little cheap shots at American hubris. Honest, I don't feel dumber after having seen it.

Bottom line though, like a good car crash, I always hove to stop and watch *Talladega Nights*, 'cause I like to party.
