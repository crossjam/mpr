[Evan Miller’s statistical material for programmers][1] might come in handy:
> As my modest contribution to developer-kind, I've collected together the
statistical formulas that I find to be most useful; this page presents them
all in one place, a sort of statistical cheat-sheet for the practicing
programmer.

> Most of these formulas can be found in Wikipedia, but others are buried in
journal articles or in professors' web pages. They are all classical (not
Bayesian), and to motivate them I have added concise commentary. I've also
added links and references, so that even if you're unfamiliar with the
underlying concepts, you can go out and learn more. Wearing a red cape is
optional.
