I don’t know why I was surprised but I recently decided to try my [MLB.com Gameday Audio][1] subscription from my laptop. [Previously, for the past few years,][3] I have been using the service exclusively from my phone. Hit the website, logged in with my pretty much never used account, and I was streaming play-by-play in 30 seconds at my desk. For some reason, I was under the impression that mobile and desktop were segregated.

Don’t know what I was thinking. [MLB Advanced Media][2] are the pros in this space.
