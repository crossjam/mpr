Link parkin’: [*GPS: A Graph Processing System*][1]
> GPS is an open-source system for scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy-to-program execution of algorithms on extremely large graphs. GPS is similar to Google’s proprietary Pregel system, and Apache Giraph. GPS is a distributed system designed to run on a cluster of machines, such as Amazon's EC2.

...

> We have completed an initial version of GPS, which is available to download. We have run GPS on up to 100 Amazon EC2 large instances and on graphs of up to 250 million vertices and 10 billion edges.

Okay, it’s from Stanford, which raises suspicion *(Go Bears!)*, but 10 billion edges is no joke.
