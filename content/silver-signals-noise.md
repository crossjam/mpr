From [Nate Silver][3]
> An excerpt from my forthcoming book, [“The Signal and the Noise,”][1] was published this week in The New York Times Magazine. You can find an online version of the excerpt [here][2].

> The book takes a comprehensive look at prediction across 13 fields, ranging from sports betting to earthquake forecasting. Since 2009, I have been traveling the country to meet with experts and practitioners in each of these fields in an effort to uncover common bonds. The book asks an ambitious question: What makes predictions succeed or fail?

Pre-ordering tonight. I had a thought about an interesting sports related challenge on the way home today. There’s enough historical play-by-play data for Major League Baseball, and possibly the National Football League, and straightforward enough grading, that you could build predictive models and test them real-time. Would be interesting to see how quickly and accurately a system could predict a game’s next pitch or play **and** outcome. 

Might be some financial opportunities there as well.

*Has it already been 4 years since 538 stormed the world? Time flies.*
