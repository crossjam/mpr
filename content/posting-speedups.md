Didn't know if it was Movable Type, MarsEdit, or my RimuHosting virtual server. I've noticed [the switch][2] to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [Linode](http://linode.com) has fixed that problem. In a big way. Posting is will night instantaneous. I suspect it's the increased memory, for the same dollars, that Linode makes available for my MySQL server.

Whatever, I'm lovin' it.
