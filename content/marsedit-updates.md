[Black Pixel][3] just had a [release][2] back in October. But when the product changed hands, Brent Simmons and Daniel Pasco got me [all hyped up][4]. Unfortunately, Black Pixel aren't the prolific [bloggers][5] compared to Brent Simmons’ [output][6].

**Update.** That's what I get for posting late when tired. Title changed to NetNewsWire from MarsEdit, another fine application which has definitely been regularly updated by its publisher.
