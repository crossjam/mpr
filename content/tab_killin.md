You might be asking, why [the big celebration][3] for getting some goofy [Rube Goldbergian][2] mail filtering process working. Basically my [information trapping][1] routine had fallen down and keeping tabs open in browsers was my version of bookmarking. At one point, I had about 4 standing Chrome windows open with double digit tabs in each window. Not to mention a few squirreled away in Safari tabs.

After I got my mail based link stashing working yesterday, I ripped through those browser tabs. 40+ links parked, with a little excerpt for each one, remotely accessible and searchable in GMail, yet indexed locally thanks to Thunderbird and Apple Mail. Took maybe about an hour, including time to select, cut, and paste the excerpt text.

Now my webtop feels much less cluttered.
