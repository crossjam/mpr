Been a long time fan of [Ted Leung's blogging][2]. He's updated his [*Macintosh Tips and Tricks* page][1] and there are plenty of good tips, pointers to useful software,  and handy tricks. Particularly useful for UNIX veterans. I'm careful reading and re-reading to see what I can add to my various workflows.
