I’ve been looking for a decent mash up of IPython and Emacs. Will definitely test drive [EIN][1]:

> Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN) provides a IPython Notebook client and integrated REPL (like SLIME) in Emacs. While EIN makes notebook editing very powerful by allowing you to use any Emacs features, it also expose IPython features such as code evaluation, object inspection and code completion to the Emacs side. These features can be accessed anywhere in Emacs and improve Python code editing and reading in Emacs.
