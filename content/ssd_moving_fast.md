Jeez Louise. Things are [moving fast on the Solid State Drive front][1]:

<blockquote><em>

Crucial said Friday that it will be debuting a new 2.5" 256GB Solid State Drive on July 20th. Solid State Drives are swiftly becoming all the rage for those looking for more performance and better reliability for their internal storage needs. The 2.5" form factor makes the drive small enough for use in laptops.

</em></blockquote>

That's a quarter of a terabyte of highly reliable storage in a small, power efficient form factor. It's not cheap now, but a year from now it will be. Or we might even have a 1 Tb SSD *(sick!!)* within a power user's price range.

While datacenters, laptops, and netbooks are the obvious targets, there might be some unintended consequences for mobile media capture and playback devices.
