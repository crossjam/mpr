[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Google Apps Logo.png" alt="Google Apps Logo.png" border="0" width="158" height="41" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] [Mass Programming Resistance](http://crossjam.net/mpr) is hosted on a little virtual private server. Recently my poor old server fell over. The disk filled up with spam and bounce notices from GMail. crossjam.net dropped off the net.

So I signed up for the [Google Apps, Standard Edition][1] and outsourced my e-mail server needs. Besides the spam deluge I was facing, I was mostly motivated by Gina Trapani [documenting the ease][2] with which the whole thing could be set up. She's also got a deeper dive into [how to configure Google Apps for Your Domain][3].

So far so good, but I need to jerry rig a way to forward my good e-mail out of GMail and into my own server as a mail backup mechanism.
