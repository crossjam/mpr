So I'm watching [the 2003 movie reboot of S.W.A.T.][1] featuring Colin Ferrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner, and Michelle Rodriguez, among others. The ultra-rich villain, in S.W.A.T. custody, is being escorted into a holding facility. But along the way he spots some TV cameras and pronounces that he'll pay *One Hundred Million Dollars (cue bad French accent)* if anyone gets him out of jail. The director promptly uses all the cheapest ethnic criminal stereotypes to indicate the forthcoming mayhem.

Immediately I thought if that video went viral on YouTube, they'd have scum coming from across the world to cut this guy loose.

Except there wasn't any YouTube in 2003. Didn't get here until 2005.

Like I said Internet Time.
