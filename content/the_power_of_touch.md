Today, using the little joystick at the center of the phone, I was scrolling through my contacts looking for a phone number. When the one I was searching for finally came up, I started tapping its row with my thumb. Tap, tap, tap. Why isn't this thing working?

Oh yeah, it's not an iPod Touch.

Keep in mind I've only had [a Touch for a month][2] and I don't make any calls with it. Yet somehow I have "muscle memory" for Apple's user interface, on any handheld screen device. Granted, I had just been using my Touch to do some feed reading, but I was still surprised by my own behavior.

Maybe it's a sign to get cracking and get a new smartphone.
