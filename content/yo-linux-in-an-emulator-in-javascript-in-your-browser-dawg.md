As [Trinity][5] said in *The Matrix Reloaded*, "That's a nice trick."

There's something sick about being able to run a C compiler in a shell within Emacs on top of Linux executing in an x86 emulator running in JavaScript embedded in my browser. And it's not dog slow! Feels like a circa 1995 PC or logging into a UNIX box over dial-up.
