Just wanted to mark the fact that I’m a fan of [Overcast][1] for subscribing to and playing podcasts. As a technonerd, I might do with a few more bells and whistles, but the overall simplicity makes it a compelling app on the iPhone. 

Overcast is good enough that I paid for an annual subscription. YMMV.
