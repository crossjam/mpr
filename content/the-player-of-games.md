Be it resolved that I will complete reading 50 books in the remainder of this calendar year.

Banks’ [*The Player of Games*][1] yesterday. I had been slogging through the first half of the book, but then the latter half really moved for me. Previously, I was [not a big fan][2] of Banks’ *Consider Phlebas*. I can recommend *The Player of Games*, although it too can be a tad disturbing at times.
