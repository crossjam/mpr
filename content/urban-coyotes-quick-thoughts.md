Enjoying the blend although my current stance is that it’s at the quality of some of his [Great Lakes Audio podcast mixes][2]. This isn’t to say that *Urban Coyotes* is bad, just not super, duper, mega, head nodding awesome like some other Farina House music mixes. In particular, the only peak for me is **Flapjackers** *Candy*.

So far, not at the top of the pantheon, but it I need to give it some more wear for fit. I’m definitely not sending it back though. 

*Am I True Chicago (™) though in immediately trainspotting [Ron Magers][3] on the voice overs? The “coyotes” pronunciation bugs me however. Should be three syllables, not two, with a long e.*
