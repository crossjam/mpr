My current thought is that the first 2/3 to 3/4 is bumpin' but the tail end still doesn't grab me. It'll probably take a few more weeks of listening to converge though.

However the three track run of:

<ul>

<li> Colossus - Dopebeatz

<li> Brawdcast - Calm Down (Instrumental)

<li> J-Boogie's Dubtronic Science* feat. Crown City Rockers - Alive (Instrumental)

</ul>

is definitely <strong>sicktastic!</strong>
