If I’m going to get serious about learning Scala, I’m going to need a serious development environment. My default would be to figure something out with Emacs, but it’s time to check out the modern kit.

Jeethu Rao documented [getting IntelliJ IDEA set up for Scala][1]:
> The class used the Typesafe Scala IDE, which is built on Eclipse. I’ve been using JetBrains PyCharm for most of my python work and when they had IntelliJ 12 Ultimate Edition on sale at a 75% discount last week, I bought it. Last night, I spent a bit of time setting up IntelliJ to work with Scala on my Retina MBP. I’m posting this as a future reference.

Hope [IDEA][2] is a bit lighter weight than Eclipse, whose enormity has always confounded me.
