Happened to be looking at my profile on [Last.fm](https://last.fm) and
noticed the following

In case you can’t make out the text from the screen capture, there’s
a __"scrobbling since June 5 2005"__ hiding in there.

Hang on! I’ve been scrobbling for 20 years 😱 ?! 

Just for calibration, that’s one year longer than The Site Formerly
Known as Twitter has existed, and one year less than TheFacebook.

Some good ’ole [Web 2.0][1] services just keep hanging in there.
