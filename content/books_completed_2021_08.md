December was decidedly better than November. Even though it wasn’t
a perfect vacation, managed to take advantage of some holiday
downtime. Seven more works completed pushes the year’s total to 42,
which isn’t too bad all things considered. Interestingly, this batch
didn’t include any self-development or business themed tomes. I need
to do a full accounting of the 2021 reading, just for posterity
and to have it all in one place.

Thoughts beneath the fold ...

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

_Angels With Dirty Faces_ was a straightforward history of Argentinian
football from conception (English arrival and playing of football) to
the modern day (Lionel Messi and the World Cup of 2010). Most
interesting things I learned about were:

1. The history of Argentina. As your standard, government issue,
   American, I’d heard some of the names, but didn’t have the full arcs
   and context.
2. The level of violence surrounding Argentine football. Even to this
   day, there’s a decent chance a full on riot can break out at a big
   derby.
3. How significant Marcelo Bielsa’s coaching influence is. I knew Pep
   Guardolia revered Bielsa, but now I know why.
   
Like _Grendel_, _Saga of the Swamp Thing: Book One_ spun me back to
the time when I collected comics. The Alan Moore _Swamp Thing_ run was
held in high regard. Revisiting the episodic, psychedelic horror was
well rewarded, although the limitations of the standard issue
DC/Marvel monthly format were quite apparent.

Amazon Kindle granted me a collection of five speculative fiction
novellas from authors of African heritage, entitled _Black Stars_. I
just picked _These Alien Skies_ at random to start with. I wasn’t
digging it until the closing punchline which actually made it worth
the effort.

Unlike many of the other football books I’ve read recently, _Das
Reboot_ captured the journey of a national team, Germany’s Die
Mannschaft, in one window of time, as opposed to being an extended
history or a look at analytics. After hitting mediocrity on the
international stage, Germany as a footballing nation went all in with
a comprehensive youth development program, the application of sport
science, and the incorporation of analytics. It resulted in winning
the 2014 world cup.

_Brilliant Orange_ is similar to _Angels With Dirty Faces_ except
applied to The Netherlands. Winner takes a slightly different tack in
trying to reconcile the intersection of Dutch culture in general with
the Dutch "Total Football" approach to soccer. And the national team’s
propensity to fall short in the big games. I’ve been struck by how
deeply footballing nations have their self-esteem wrapped up in their
national teams, possibly best exhibited in the apopletic last chapter
of _Brilliant Orange_ where the Dutch team made it to the finals of
the 2010 World Cup but played in a style that depending on who you ask
brought extreme disgrace upon the nation.

The four tales of _Radicalized_ are soul-crushingly bleak, with thin
strands of hope embedded. The future is so dim, we’ll need
nightvision. I’ll admit though, Doctorow did have my heart pounding
regarding Salima’s fate in _Unauthorized Bread_.

_Football Hackers_ is an interesting look at how quantitaive
approaches, and the characters behind them, are tackling global
football which, as a rare event game, is quite hard to tame
analytically. Turns out though, there’s all sorts of stuff off the
pitch that comes into play where folks are starting to make hay.
