Sometimes you're reminded of old friends that you hadn't given a thought to in ages. Then you realize you really miss them and wish they were around again.

808 State's [*Cubik*][1] is one of those old friends. I remember using two 12 inches of this track for one of my earliest DJ tricks, a simple jet/flange. [Bought][2], although it's not exactly the *Pan American Excursion* mix, which is the true classic.
