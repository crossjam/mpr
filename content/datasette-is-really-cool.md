Simon Willison’s [`datasette` project][1] is just totally darn cool. If you have some data in an [sqlite][2] database (or in a csv file which is [easily turned into an sqlite db][3]) then `datasette` makes it easy to publish that data on the Web. With data oriented retrieval APIs for free!

The project mostly emerged while I was out in the blogging wilderness. I’ve had opportunity to use it in anger and can highly recommend it. There have been more sophisticated and complex means to achieve the same goals, and maybe even more elegant toolkits that never quite got adoption, but `datasette` strikes a beautiful balance between pragmatism, utility, and beauty.
