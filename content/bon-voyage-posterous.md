Something about self-hosting my blogging space is just a better fit. However, I did manage to use Posterous for an extended period of [narrating my 100Hours project][2].

Well, [Posterous has recently been acquired by Twitter][3]. Looks like the service will run for a while, but these events always are uncertainty generators. Probably a good idea to export my data for “posterity”, yuk, yuk. Congrats to the team for a successful exit.
