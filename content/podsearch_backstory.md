I don’t listen to too many episodes of Jon Gruber’s _The Talk
Show_. When I do, I find [the show’s unofficial transcripts][1] at
[PodSearch][3], really useful.

Here’s [the backstory][2] on how David Smith brought PodSearch into the
modern AI era:

> Thankfully since then OpenAI has released Whisper a powerful
> speech-to-text engine that I can run right on my Mac and results in
> transcripts that are shockingly good. They aren’t quite at the level
> of a human transcriber but they get darn close in many
> instances. Getting close to the level where you could use them to
> grab a pull quote with only a little bit of tidying up to do. 
>
> Moreover, because I can just run this locally it is essentially
> ‘free’ to run, costing only my CPU time. So I can much more easily
> keep it up to date and incorporate the entire back catalogs of the
> shows I’m indexing.

> The updated site can be found at podsearch.david-smith.org. I hope
> you find it helpful and fun to explore. You can easily search for
> the occurrences of particular keywords within a particular show and
> find the timestamp of when it was said.
