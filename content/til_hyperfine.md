> A command-line benchmarking tool.

Might not read obvious, but it’s a command-line tool that looks really
handy for benchmarking other command-line tools. Should replace the
`time` command, but it’s way more than that. Has a ton of features
including things like "statistical analysis across multiple runs" and
exporting results to CSV, JSON, Markdown, etc.
