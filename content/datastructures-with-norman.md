Speaking of finding interesting things on @PyPi, here’s [Norman][1]
> Norman is a framework for advanced data structures in python using an database-like approach. The range of potential applications is wide, for example in-memory databases, multi-keyed dictionaries or node graphs.

For the longest time I’ve been thinking one could transliterate [prefuse][2] into Python to enable interactive visualization programming at a high level. The critical hurdle was prefuse’s table oriented datastructures and queries. In-memory sqlite could probably do the trick, but then you’ve got to deal with serialization and deserialization of Python objects.

Norman looks like it might fit the bill better for a prefuse knockoff.
