As I’ve been getting in more reps with Claude Code, I’ve independently
followed a similar trail to Ruby. I spend a significant amount of time
creating plan documents, having the coding agent generate plans along
with implementation summaries, and making the agent process error
messages to create tests. Helpful confirmation since he’s a way better
developer than I am.

Apropos of nothing, feels like I’ve been reading Sam’s work for
ages. He was a very early, high quality tech blogger, especially
around RSS. He seems to have come back to the trade after exiting [a
stint][3] with [fly.io](https://fly.io) which is great. Courtesy of
him, [TIL][4] about [Vector](https://vector.dev). That’s for another
post though.
