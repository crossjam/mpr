Title: Back in the Saddle

I’m gainfully unemployed again. 5 years, 2 DARPA programs from start
to finish, 2 more business thrusts launched with long runway, and 1
global pandemic to top it off! The separation was completely amicable
and I initiated it. Me and the previous company both evolved and were
trending in different directions. There’s no immediate employment
lined up.

Commence sabbatical. Relaxing, recharging, and reprogramming
myself. Need to work on some family and health issues. Making room to
catch up with friends old and new. Time to learn enough about
generative AI to seriously tinker and be able to call BS on snakeoil
salesmen. Plus space for a few other fun tech things like music data
hacking and [Rust][1] programming. Haven’t traveled outside of the DMV for
three years. Gonna’ actually go places.

I’ve twice left positions without the "next" thing lined up. The first
time, there was really no plan. Bad idea. Wound up muddling along for
about three months and almost induced financial ruin. Lucked into a
good position that led to great returns. The second time, I had a
half-baked plan but didn’t game out the financial timing well. Really
could have easily gone sideways, but at least there were backup
plans. Thankfully it all worked out.

This time around? Financial runway secured. High probability
opportunities being worked and my personal network tapped for more as
insurance. If all goes to plan, it’ll be about a three month
sabbatical, but if it goes longer I won’t enter panic mode until 2024.

Which means I now have plenty of time to blog. There’s a fair bit to
say. We go again!
