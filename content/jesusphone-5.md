I ordered an iPhone 5 a couple of weeks ago, it arrived at my local AT&T this past Thursday, and I picked it up yesterday. I’ll admit it. I made a halfass attempt to wait in line on the first day. There was enough of a line to turn me away, even in the hinterlands of Northern Virginia. If I’d stuck it out, given I was going top shelf for a 64 Gb model, I might have actually gotten one to gloat about. But I had other stuff to do.

So here’s my pure, initial impulse reaction based on less than 36 hours of ownership.

I’d have been **real $?!& salty** if I’d stood in line a couple of hours for this thing. Physically longer and lighter? Big deal. Ear pods still don’t stay in my ears. Yet another cable to carry, woohoo! And I sort of liked the iPhone 4’s backglass, which gave it a nice heft. Maybe you can be too thin.

But. **But!** **BUT!!** ... The combination of the new  A6 processor and 4G networking makes the iPhone 5 fast as hell. Stuff I’d use to twiddle my thumbs waiting for on the 4? Done!

And the more you use it, the more you notice.

The biggest hurdle is that I transitioned from an early 2000's poor excuse for a “smart phone” to the iPhone 4, a quantum leap. So anything less could feel like falling short.

But I think the 5 might be a keeper.
