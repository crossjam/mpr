So all I really needed to get out of [Williams’ *Big Idea* entry][1] for John Scalzi's writer self-promotion series, was that Williams’ new book [*The Fourth Wall*][3] is on store shelves. Even better this is a continuation of the Dagmar Shaw series. Our intrepid Alternative Reality Game designer is making a return appearance in what looks like an exploration of the future of entertainment and media.

Check out WJW’s pitch if you need more convincing. Me? I'm going [straight to Amazon][2] after I finish this post.
