Title: ToolLLM

> 🔨This project (ToolLLM) aims to construct open-source, large-scale,
> high-quality instruction tuning SFT data to facilitate the
> construction of powerful LLMs with general tool-use capability. We
> aim to empower open-source LLMs to master thousands of diverse
> real-world APIs. We achieve this by collecting a high-quality
> instruction-tuning dataset. It is constructed automatically using
> the latest ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k), which is upgraded with
> enhanced function call capabilities. We provide the dataset, the
> corresponding training and evaluation scripts, and a capable model
> ToolLLaMA fine-tuned on ToolBench.
