[MarsEdit][2], my desktop blogging tool, is finally [getting some upgrades][1].

> It’s been over 7 years since MarsEdit 3 was released. Typically I would like to maintain a schedule of releasing major upgrades every two to three years. This time, a variety of unexpected challenges led to a longer and longer delay.

> The good news? MarsEdit 4 is finally shaping up. I plan to release the update later this year.
