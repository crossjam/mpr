I’ve gotten back into consistently collecting [links of interest][3] and started heavily using the fine [Pinboard][2] product. Capturing links from iOS devices was a drag though, having to go through a JavaScript bookmarklet. Felt sort of convoluted. Too much friction. But my iPhone and iPad are the places where I run across most of the links I want to stash.

Enter [Pinner][1], a $4.99 app. A little pricey, but it looks very nice and provides a clean experience for browsing Pinboard. Best of all it adds a custom [share sheet][4] so posting a link to Pinboard is just one click away.
