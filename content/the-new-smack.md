You know you’ve been around awhile when you start observing “acronym recycling”.

 When I first heard the term in  Ben Lorica’s O’Reilly Data Show [podcast episode][3] with Evan Chan, I did a double take. Trawling the interwebs a bit looks like there might be [some there there][2]. [MeetUps][4]. [Slides][6]. [Talks][7]. [Conferences, sort of][5]. Even [manifestos][8]!

Not exactly one-to-one, but definitely square in the same ecosystem. The 2010 Radar article is still surprisingly relevant. And if you think of the trends in “Big Data” over the last 5+ years, SMACK is basically an evolution of SMAQ, refined for the rise of Spark as a compute engine, and updated for the emergence of streaming, unbounded data processing.

SMACK HARD is a little too cute by half though, if you ask me.
