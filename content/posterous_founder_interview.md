I'm typically not into The Cult of Startup, but I do like the [posterous](http://posterous.com) product. I'm even [using posterous][2] in a casual way. [Robert Scoble][3] conducted [an entertaining interview][1] with the founders of the tiny company, Sachin Agarwal and Garry Tan.

Nothing super deep to be gained other than that the "post" in posterous rhymes with imposter not postal, as I incorrectly thought. Still enjoyed the founders' perspective on what they've accomplished and where they're going. Looking forward to seeing some of those new features.
