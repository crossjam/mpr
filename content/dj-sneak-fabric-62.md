An alert that [DJ Sneak’s *Fabric 62*][1] had been released. With digital download immediately available to boot.

[Sneak][2] occupies an odd place in my house music affections. I love, Love, **LOVE**, his cut *Show Me the Way*, off of [*The Polyester E.P.*][3]. It may be one of my favorite anthems ever. On the other hand, I've never really fallen for any of his mix cd’s. They've all been passable, and I got *Fabric 62* just in case there's a breakthrough, but none of them have ever been on continuous repeat for me. That's been reserved for folks like Lil’ Louie Vega and Evol Intent.

After first listen, seems like *Fabric 62* won’t hit heavy rotation. Lost my headphones and haven’t been able to give it a repeat, but we'll give it a chance to breath.
