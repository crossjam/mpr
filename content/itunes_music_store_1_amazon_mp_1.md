That criticism still stands, but a crack has appeared in iTMS armor!

None of [Big Daddy Kane's](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Big+Daddy+Kane) classics like [*Raw*](http://www.discogs.com/Big-Daddy-Kane-Raw/release/183519), [*Ain't No Half Steppin*](http://www.discogs.com/Big-Daddy-Kane-Aint-No-Half-Steppin/release/416373), and [*Smooth Operator*][1] are in the iTMS. In fact, it doesn't look like **any** of the [Cold Chillin'](http://www.discogs.com/label/Cold+Chillin%27) catalog is in the store. Boooooo!

Thankfully, the Amazon MP3 store at least has [*Marley Marl's House of Hits*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QQXWIA/). Okay, so you can't get [*Smooth Operator*][1], but digital versions of [*The Symphony, Part 1*][2] and [*The Bridge*][3] more than make up for it. The rest of the collection isn't that bad either.

Ob Trivia. [*The Bridge*][3] was originally a B side. The supposedly lesser side of a 12" vinyl record for you youngsters out there. Which reminds me to dig up Public Enemy's [*B Side Wins Again*][4]
