Back in the groove for August. The tally will only show four books
completed for this month, but there were two more in the hopper that
will close this weekend. September should reap five completions if not six.

* [_Apex_][1], Ramez Naam
* [_Pep Confidential_][2], Martí Perarnau
* [_The Expected Goal Philosophy_][3], James Tippett
* [_The Consuming Fire_][4], John Scalzi


_The Consuming Fire_ won’t make the top of my literary style list,
being a big fan of Ursula K. LeGuin and William Gibson. A lot more
exposition than I usually like. But fuck if _The Consuming Fire_ (and
_The Collapsing Empire_ as well) aren’t fun, easy reads. And damn if
Kiva Lagos ain’t a motherfucking hoot!

_Apex_ exemplifies my distate of the technothriller genre. A sprawl of
plot arcs, coming and going in fits and starts. Named characters
constantly being introduced, without enough room for
development. Fetishizing of national security apparati. It’s been a
while since I read _Nexus_ and _Crux_, the other books in the trilogy,
but the underlying neuroscientific principles were compelling. Glad I
closed out the trilogy but probably not revisiting.

Apparently a key element of the _The Expected Goal Philosophy_ is
constantly moaning about how people who haven’t bought into the
philosophy are morons. Slightly offputting. The actual details of the
stastical approach turn out to be somewhat pedestrian at the end of
the day, but good to know about as football evolves. Might have read
better as a pure underdog story, similar to _Moneyball_.

_Pep Confidential_ turned out to be less of a hagiography then I
expected, which was good. As a Manchester City fan, I was intrigued by
the insights from his prior stop at Bayern Munich. I’m still a newbie
regarding football tactics, so _Confidential_ was a very revealing
look behind the scenes. Also, quite entertaining given that many of
the names involved are still active in world football, like Thiago
Alcântara, David Alaba, Mario Mandzukić, Tony Kroos, and Pierre-Emile
Højbjerg, with the lens of history to see their subsequent
paths. Looking forward to reading Perarnau’s follow-up _Pep Guardiola,
The Evolution_.

_Apropos Elle Driver, "You know, I’ve always liked that word
... hagiography ... so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a
sentence."_
