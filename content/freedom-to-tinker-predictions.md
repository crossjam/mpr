Had to let ’em simmer for a bit, but [Freedom To Tinker’s annual predictions][1]  are always a good read. If it all happens, it’s gonna be a bad year, but particularly in the skies: 

> Civilian versions of military UAVs, like the Predator, will gain broader approval for use in domestic airspace and will be rapidly adopted by the obvious government agencies (e.g. police departments, border patrol, USGS) as well as all manner of unexpected non-government applications (e.g. traffic reporting, aerial banner advertising). “Deconflicting” airspace will become a hot topic for discussion.

You have to search and scroll a bit, but the earlier years’ predictions often had a surprisingly prescient nugget. For example, there are certain bets regarding the CFAA that are quite on point given the recent Aaron Swartz tragedy.

And of course everyone has a clunker or two:

> (28) Facebook will be sold for $4 billion and Mark Zuckerberg will step down as CEO.

That’s the price of prognostication.
