Given this, admittedly limited, [comparison][2] between the 13" MacBook Pro and 13" MacBook Air, I may have to mix it into [my thought process][3] about a new laptop. More horsepower and more memory expansion is tempting to tradeoff for the 50% weight and better resolution. Then again, it feels a lot like settling for the middle of the road. But it’s a personal machine I’m not trying to [make money with][2], so why not do something different and work through the challenges? Something to consider.
