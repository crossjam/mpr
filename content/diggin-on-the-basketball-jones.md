Have to say recently I've quite been enjoying [The Basketball Jones][1] in general, and [Trey Kerby][2] in particular. Mostly because Kerby's been [entertainingly][4] [skewering][5] the hometown team, a.k.a. [the Washington Wizards][3]. But the overall NBA coverage is a hoot as well.

Seriously, I actually laugh out loud on a daily basis thanks to TBJ!
