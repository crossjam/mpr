Once upon a time, [I posted 80 times][1] in one month. Then followed it up with three straight months of 50 or more posts. Yowza!

Different era though. Link blogging was more in fashion and of course I had way more discretionary time. Plus, the task actually did support getting insights related to my research agenda of the moment.

Link blogging is sort of fun though. Between faving tweets and starring feed items, feels like I should be able to mash something up into my own hosted Tumblr style blog.
