[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/On Lisp Cover.gif" alt="On Lisp Cover.gif" border="0" width="130" height="200" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][5] I was probably one of the [earliest fans][1] of [Paul Graham's writings][3], even predicting the essay collection [*Hackers and Painters*][6]. Before that I actually bought copies of [*Ansi Common Lisp*][4] (2!) and [*On Lisp*][5]. All three **copies** (I never did buy *Hackers and Painters*) are proudly gathering dust in storage, along with my Lisp hacking skillz. I should point out that both titles are actually quite good and well written.

For some reason, I found his recent essay [*The List of N Things*][2] to be exceptionally amusing. Part of the charm is a bit of winking inconsistency that actually leads to solid consistency.  Or vice-versa? *Waitaminnit*

Add in the fact that his popular [Hacker News][7] site occasionally seems to be overrun with [listicles][8] and there's even more fun for the whole family.

Sometimes I am quite easily amused.
