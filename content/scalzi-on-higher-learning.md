I swear I was just about to compose a reader request to Jon Scalzi regarding his thoughts on being from an “elite of the elite” university and advice he’d give to his daughter in these days of MOOCs etc. [From my thoughts to Scalzi’s keyboard][1], although I would have been more entertaining than Steve, throwing in lots of Ivy class bonhomie and all that and dropping in a “where fun goes to die” or two:
> Presuming my kid has the chops to get in where she wants to go — which I find a reasonable presumption, all things concerned — what I am likely to tell her is this: I’m willing to pay for an elite private institution (think generally but not exclusively the top 25 colleges and the top 25 universities in the US) because their reputations/networks are worth the additional expense in long run. But outside of those schools, why would I pay $40,000+ for a private school when I can pay $10,000 for Ohio State or Ohio University, or only slightly more for Miami University? The value add — the reputation/network — isn’t there in almost all those cases.

I strongly agree with this assessment and keep in mind I’ve been at just about every stage of the pipe: undergrad, grad, faculty, washed up faculty. Haven’t been an educational administrator at any level but I’m not sure I’d wish that on anyone ;-) *(Ha! Ha! Only serious)*

And we both believe that college can still have a lot of value for a lot of people in this age. I bring this up because there seems to be this virulent dismissive current in the tech and business communities that “higher learning is completely busted, worthless, and mega-disruptive entrepreneurialism is gonna save the day”. I get that there’s a lot of overpriced product out there, but if I see one more link about how a PhD is meaningless, I’m gonna barf. Even if it’s in Critical Literature, just because you can’t reap some huge financial windfall doesn’t mean the result has no value. If there’s a true research oriented dissertation, than at least the ball of humanity’s knowledge has been pushed forward the tiniest bit.
