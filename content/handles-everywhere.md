I’ve become mildly amused by the penetration of Twitter usage throughout mainstream media. To my eye there’s been an especially urgent burst in the sports world. ESPN has gone overboard with @ handles for every on-air personality, a # hashtag for every show, and constant urges for viewers to participate. 

Then there’s [Shaq][1] on TNT.

Oddly in social networking (Twitter, Facebook, Google+) it feels like search circa 1995. There’s a solid technology baseline but disruption seems right around the corner.
