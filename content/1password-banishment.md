Turning on the Chrome process tracker revealed that the [1Password][1] extension  would blow up to over 100 Mb of virtual memory. Then when I would kill that specific process, Chrome would wholeheartedly lock up. A force quit was needed to take out the crashing browser. My laptop was showing a load of over 35!!

[AgileBits](https://agilebits.com/) doesn't seem close to [solving the problem][2], so I'm just going to stick to using the 1Password extension in Firefox. There it seems much more well behaved. Meanwhile I just completely disabled the extension within Chrome. Now my laptop is a much happier camper.
