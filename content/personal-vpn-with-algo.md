Also in the bin of interesting potential side projects, would be deploying an [Algo][3] server for a personal VPN.

From the original [Algo announcement post][1]:
> Today we’re introducing Algo, a self-hosted personal VPN server designed for ease of deployment and security. Algo automatically deploys an on-demand VPN service in the cloud that is not shared with other users, relies on only modern protocols and ciphers, and includes only the minimal software you need.

There’s richer and more recent detail in [The Changelog podcast Episode 377][2].
