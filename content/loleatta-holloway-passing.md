[Loleatta Holloway passed away][2] back in March. While clearly a disco icon, through the modern miracle of sampling and the 80's to early 90's wild west of rights clearance, she was also a huge influence on House music. At a certain point, it felt like every new Strictly Rhythm single had to have a Holloway sample. 

The greatness and contribution really hit me, when I bought the Mastercuts [*Classic Salsoul volume 2*][3], and first encountered the 11 minute version of [*Hit and Run*][1]. The track starts off with about 3-4 minutes of classic disco. Then it launches into another 7 minutes of soulful beats, jazzy riffs, and Loleatta bringin' the pipes. But she also scatted for bits and played it low and husky for spells. Just a tour de force of soul diva vocals. 

After all that, which I'm assuming was one take, the closing words of the producer just kills it, *"Okay, now let's do the album version."*

Godspeed kind lady.

**N.b.** *If you get the Classic Salsoul volume 2, you get First Choice's Dr. Love, another disco/house classic.*
