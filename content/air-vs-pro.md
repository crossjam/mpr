So the announcement that I’d [been pining for][5] came today, with [Apple unveiling new products][1] in both the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines. The new hotness of the top of the line 15" MacBook Pro, with Retina display, is pretty much [my dream replacement][2] for Ye Olde White MacBook. Heck, it can even be bumped up to 16 Gb of RAM with 768 Gb of SSD, for a small fee.

The 13" MacBook Airs deserve serious consideration though. First, while the Pro has slimmed down, the Airs are still 50% lighter. These days I’m extremely desirous of being leaner and meaner. The Airs can have their RAM upgraded to 8 Gb. The kicker is a 13" MacBook Air kitted out with more RAM and 512 Gb of SSD *($500, yikes!!)* is still about $800 less than the equivalent 15" MacBook Pro. Obviously you get more cores, more Ghz, and more screen real estate, but $800 is 80% of the way to a Cinema Display for the desktop.

Interestingly, Apple claims the same battery life for both lines, roughly 7 hours, despite what must be a significant difference due to the Pro’s advanced display.

So serious top of the line mobile horsepower vs smaller, lighter, capable and significantly cheaper. Tough decision. I’ll wait for the in-depth nerd reviews and hold on until [the 4th Macaversary][3].
