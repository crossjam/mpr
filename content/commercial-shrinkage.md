Repeated viewing leads to some obscure observations. Like the fact that most commercials lose content as time goes on. As an example our fine friends at ESPN have taken their most recent "It's Not Crazy, It's Sports" [spot][1] *(It's like a Big Papi without the cheese)* and [shrinrayed][2] the bit for a new online contest at [thefanwiches.com](http://thefanwiches.com/).

Which of course leads into the suckage that is Facebook. 

This may be a sign that I have too much time on my hands.
