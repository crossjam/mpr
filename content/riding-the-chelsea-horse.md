The [Premiership][2] starts tomorrow. I'm dumping Arsenal and rooting for [Chelsea][1] this campaign. Hopefully The Blues won't gack at the finish line like they did last year. Doesn't look like Chelsea made many [moves][3] over the summer, but maybe having Fernando Torres from the get-go will lead to a more dynamic squad.

Two things I learned about The Premier League last year. First, I didn't know the season was so long. Pretty close to a nine month schedule. Second, the top teams are actually playing four seasons simultaneously: Premier League, [Champions League][6], [FA Cup][5], [Carling Cup][4]. That's a lot of football!
