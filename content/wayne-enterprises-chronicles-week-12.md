Well that feeling is topped by going into **Sunday** period, fairly comfortable you’re going to win and clinch a playoff spot.

I didn’t really plan it this way, but I had two fantasy players in each of Thanksgiving Day’s three NFL games:

* **Robert Griffin III** lit up Dallas, and delivered 35 fantasy points.
* **Miles Austin**, thanks for nothing
* **Arian Foster**, got his usual 20+, 26 in fact, befitting the #1 overall pick
* **Shayne Graham**, got the benefit of overtime for 11 points out of the kicker position
* **Stevan Ridley**, picked up some garbage points in New England’s shellacking of the Jets, delivering 15.7 fantasy points
* I learned my lesson last week about the **New England DEF** and they rewarded me this week with 25 in the bank

Rolled into Sunday with 113 points on the board, and 2 players left. Going into Sunday night, Aaron Rodgers would have needed a historic fantasy performance without giving up much to Randall Cobb, who I was starting. Neither did particular well, which was fine by me.

That’s three wins in a row. And if my math’s correct, I’m back in the fantasy playoffs.
