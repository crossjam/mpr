Despite [dancing with the bleeding edge Android models][2], I got the [*JesusPhone* (apropos Stross)][6] mainly because I wanted to stay with AT&T.

That's right, *stay with AT&T*. I'm not a huge voice user. Coverage in the DC area is pretty solid. And I wanted to [fold my plan and my wife's plan into a family plan][7]. Prying her off off AT&T would have been more trouble than it's worth. The choice has worked out well. Our combined plan totals about $90 a month, which isn't a huge cost savings but now I have 2Gb of 3G connectivity a month and 200 text messages.

And the iPhone makes a **great** ubiquitously available, interstitial computing device. Each one uniquely kitted out with a passel of apps, they create their own **pocket universes**, the 3G connectivity making wormholes across space and time.

Now if they'd just get around to enabling a [mobile hotspot][8] feature, the dang thing would be perfect.
