This one had been bugging me for a while. I had a big playlist of dj mix MP3s downloaded from the 'Net. Hadn't listened to the vast majority and wanted to nuke 'em all in one fell swoop. Selecting all and hitting `Delete` just removed them from the playlist.

Turns out selecting in the playlist and hitting [`Option-Delete` deletes from the iTunes library][1].

Sanity preserved. Space recovered. Thanks Google. Thanks [Mac OS X Hints](http://www.macosxhints.com). Hope this post helps someone else get over this hump.
