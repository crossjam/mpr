* [RQ][1], a simple Python task queue, based upon [Redis][2]
* [How][3] to get [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org) working on Mac OS X Lion, needed for…
* [pyprocessing][4], which I'm highly impressed by, mostly because it feels pretty speedy, even on the order of [processing](http://processing.org/) itself
* The [ScipySuperPack][5] which installs a collection or prebuilt scientific computing packages in the Mac OS X default python. Convenient for getting [pandas][6] installed since it's been a bit finicky for me.
* The [IPython HTML Notebook][7] which, after watching the [PyCon presentation][8] on it, is stupefyingly cool. Actually given the HTML notebook, [the Qt console][12], and its [parallel computing facilities][13], [IPython][11] itself is just damn nice.
* It's also cool that [pyvideo][9] exists, especially since they collected [all of the PyCon 2012 presentations][10].
* [d3py][14]: *“This is d3py: a plotting library for python based on d3. The aim of d3py is to provide a simple way to plot data from the command line or simple scripts into a browser window.”*
