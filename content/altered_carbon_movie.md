[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Altered Carbon Header.png" alt="Altered Carbon Header.png" border="0" width="200" height="163" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] [io9.com's](http://io9.com) Lauren Davis reports that there's [some hope for an *Altered Carbon* movie][1]. The film would be directed by James McTeigue, who guided the [*V for Vendetta*][2] flick which I actually quite enjoyed even though I didn't consider it a great movie. McTeigue also worked with the Wachowski brothers on *The Matrix* trilogy.

A screen version of *Altered Carbon* would provide an opportunity to do an update on the urban designs and themes of *Blade Runner*. Obviously it's almost impossible to one up Ridley Scott's classic, but I'd like to see someone try to advance that chic with modern CG techniques.

Come to think of it, while McTeigue may have potential, [Ridley Scott][3] is the ideal person to direct.
