They're down three games to one against a Miami Heat with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and a host of sequentially resusscitated role players ala Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller. What next? Eric Dampier goes for 20?

I had been telling people around Christmas that this might be the year LeBron embraces his inner villain and gets mean enough to grab a ring. They were playing that sick D that led to the Lakers getting hammered on Christmas day. 

Somewhere along the season, that level of defense started to brown-out against the other elite teams in the league at the worst possible time. But, as [The Sports Grid noticed][1], the D is back with a vengeance: 

> *Obviously the Heat are more than one guy on defense. They are more than two guys. They’re a whole team of guys with long arms who are committed to shutting down the other team, plus Mike Bibby. However, having LeBron James at their disposal certainly makes things easier.*


Got a pretty good laugh out of that Mike Bibby dig.

So Da Young Bulls will probably exit stage left after a great season. Even as currently configured, they're challenging the Heat. If D Rose drains one of those last minute shots, we're talking a three game series with home court advantage. This could be the beginning of a great rivalry. I figure one more top notch (not elite) scorer for Chicago could make the difference. Then again, the Heat will have some cap flexibility next year and can upgrade too.
