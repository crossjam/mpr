Looks like Emacs 24.3 is an official release now. Mickey at [*Mastering Emacs*][1] has [an overview of some of the changes][2]: 

>> A new version of python.el, which provides several new features, including:
per-buffer shells, better indentation, Python 3 support, and improved
shell-interaction compatible with iPython (and virtually any other
text based shell).

> I blogged about a new python mode a long time ago and it seems it’s made it into trunk. That’s probably good news for most Python users, but as I haven’t yet explored the new python.el mode yet, I will cover this in much greater detail in another post.

Better iPython integration would be a boon although I’ll admit the [Emacs IPython Notebook][3] is pretty saucy. Definitely, a must test drive.
