[Tailscale][1] is a VPN for the rest of us:

> A frustratingly simple VPN

> Tailscale lets you easily manage access to private resources,
> quickly SSH into devices on your network, and work securely from
> anywhere in the world. 

Oddly, while I probably could have put Tailscale to gainful use for
quite some time, instead I just admired the technical depth of their
[blog posts][2]. There’s been a lot of [hype, criticism, discussion,
etc.][3] but the product seems to be a bit of a hit.

With a few spare cycles I finally decided to bite the bullet and give
Tailscale a shot. In the last 24 hours, I’ve installed it on six
machines, a mix of Linux, macOS, and iOS. Three are desktops/servers
in my home, one’s a relatively stationary laptop, another’s a cloud
node, and the last is an iPad. All easy, peasy 5-10 minute
installs. The UX is to die for.

Haven’t attempted to use while away from homebase which is the next
round of testing. So far, so good.

[Once upon a time][6] I noodled around with [ZeroTier][4], which still
seems to be chugging along. At that moment, the UX for ZeroTier was
nowhere as smooth as Tailscale now, especially the outsourced identity
management. I expect ZeroTier has sanded off a lot of the rough
edges. The Tailscale folks even consider [ZeroTier an admirable
competitor][5].
