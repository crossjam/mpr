Hardware cost is pretty reasonable for a front line smartphone: $199. I was hoping for a little better plan pricing though. Forced into a $70 "premium" smartphone plan. Then a mandatory $10 for 4G that I can't even get? Thank god my mother in law lives in Chicago, so I might at least get an occasional taste.  Sprint better roll out that 4G in DC quick. Add $30 for Mi-Fi capability and I'm looking at $110 a month.

Hmmmmm. Some serious financial analysis will be the order of the day.

But apparently [the HTC Evo 4G handles video][1] like a champ.
