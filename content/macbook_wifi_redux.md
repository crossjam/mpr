All right, looks like I finally got to the bottom of my [WiFi issues][2]. The [solution][1] was correctly documented in the Apple support forums. There were a couple of steps I skipped though, in my haste, that clean up some cache of kernel extensions MocOS keeps.

Followed the procedure to the letter and now I'm happily blogging, sans power cable, wirelessly.
