The usual suspects, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham , Chelsea, and Arsenal, are at the top, with the Blues a bit disappointing, the Gunners [surprisingly resilient][2], and the Spurs a welcome new face. After the [8-2 beatdown][3] ManU gave Arsenal earlier in the year, and the acrimony heaped on Arsene Wenger, the Gunners are within striking distance of Chelsea, the fourth spot, and Champions League next year.

We'll see how far they've really come though, what with a visit from Manchester United this afternoon. Add to that Tottenham traveling to Manchester City and it's a pretty important day in the Premier League.

Good timing for a great match day with the NFL Conference Championships late in the day and no games between ranked teams in NCAA Men's Basketball. 

**Update.** Both matches were quite entertaining, although I found the Man City / Tottenham game much more compelling. Gotta give the Spurs credit for coming back from two goals down to level. Thought the Gunners were gonna cave, but they fought back too. Not a top move by Wenger though, bringing in Arshavin.
