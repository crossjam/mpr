[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/posterous logo.png" alt="posterous logo.png" border="0" width="129" height="130" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][2] I haven't been using [Posterous][2] as much as [I would like][3], but I'm keeping an eye on what they're up to. Today [Posterous added theming][1], allowing users to more creatively style the look and feel of their Posterous sites.

I don't know how well it actually works, but from reading the description Posterous was smart in the theming mechanisms it made available. First, you can just pick from a canned set of Posterous provided themes. Second, their engine is compatible with themes for Tumblr. This taps into a vibrant, pre-existing market or power users can write their own themes.

They're quietly flying under the radar, but I get the sense that the Posterous team is putting together a good product.
