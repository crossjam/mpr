I recently tapped into [the MapBox blog][2] and they [announced TileMill 0.9.1][3]:

> *We just released TileMill 0.9.1, which adds support for PostGIS 2.0, runs on the latest Node.js 0.6.17 release, and provides packages for the latest Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) distribution: 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). TileMill 0.9.1 is the culmination of a several month sprint on stability, with over 80 tickets closed. The full list of fixes and advances for this release can be found in the changelog. Here are a few highlights.*

[TileMill][1] sounds so cool but I really have no idea what you do with it other than “make maps”. Ah, here we go:

> *TileMill is an application for making beautiful maps. Whether you're a journalist, web designer, researcher,	 or seasoned cartographer, TileMill is the design studio you need to create compelling, interactive maps.*

My only question is whether it also eases the effort to serve your maps for web clients? After one has made their maps can you just point a browser at an obvious server and go to town? 

Seems like something to learn. Could be another personal project.

*Shout out to [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) as a DC area concern.*
