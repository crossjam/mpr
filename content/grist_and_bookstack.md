Two things I’m planning to mess about with for personal knowledge
management, both with the potential for self-hosting. First, [Grist][1]

> Grist is a software product to organize, analyze, and share data.
>
> Grist combines the best of spreadsheets and databases. Grist lets
> you work with simple grids and lists, and is at its best when data
> gets more complex.


And [Bookstack][2], similar to Confluence with Markdown support

> BookStack is a simple, self-hosted, easy-to-use platform for
> organising and storing information.
