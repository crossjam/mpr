Herewith, some recommendations of independently published eBooks. If
you’re inclined to shop small, give these authors a shout.

[Adam Johnson][1] is a Django project committer. He’s written multiple
books on DX or "development experience" in my book. Instruction on how
developers can improve their experience using certain development
tools.

First, the older [_Boost Your Git DX_][2]

> This book covers the best command line Git tools, techniques, tips,
> tricks, and tactical tidbits I’ve encountered from over a decade of
> using Git. The selection reflects my preferences for well-maintained
> tools that provide high value with little need for customization. 

> Note that this book is not an introduction to Git and assumes that
> you’re already using Git on a daily basis. It offers ways to improve
> your developer experience with Git that ultimately help you code
> faster. 

I bought it a while back and read it end-to-end. Since I’m a
[magit][3] user on a minute to minute basis, much of it wasn’t
directly relevant. But I learned a lot about git and there are some
recommendations I need to implement for those actual terminal
interactions with the git CLI.

Second, the newer [_Boost Your GitHub DX_][4]

> This is a book about using GitHub more effectively, touring you
> through the fundamental features with my experience-based
> commentary. It covers settings, keyboard shortcuts, hidden features,
> syntax, techniques, CLI commands, and even improving your
> writing. These tools will help you collaborate more effectively with
> your team and deliver higher-quality software faster. 

> This book is aimed at anyone using GitHub on a daily basis, assuming
> you have some familiarity with GitHub and Git and want to go deeper. 

Purchased but not yet read. As I attempt to push more development onto
agentic coders, I’m using GitHub as the central platform to coordinate
with systems like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini. Specifically, I want
to heavily leverage issues and PRs to track feature
implementation. Betting Adam’s book will come in handy, especially in
taking advantage of the GitHub CLI tool.

Third, [Michael Kennedy’s][6] [_Talk Python in Production_][5]

> Welcome to Talk Python in Production, a hands-on guide for Python
> developers determined to master real-world deployment and
> infrastructure management. Have you ever felt locked into pricey
> cloud services or struggled with overly complex DevOps
> configurations? This book's stack-native approach offers a
> refreshing alternative. 

> You'll learn to containerize Python apps, secure them with NGINX,
> tap into CDNs for global performance, and manage everything on a
> single, powerful server, without sacrificing reliability. Along the
> way, you'll see exactly how we evolved Talk Python's own web
> infrastructure over many years of practical deployment
> experience. This isn't just theory: discover cost-saving tips,
> real-world examples, and step-by-step tutorials you can put to use
> right away. By the end, you'll be confident in running your Python
> applications at scale, with minimal cloud lock-in and maximum
> control over your technology stack. 

My primary interest here is in self-deploying HTTP traffic analytics
and uptime monitoring. I’ve got multiple sites on The Web and a minor
interest in understanding visitors to one or two. I’ve plunked down
for Kennedy’s book and looking forward to getting stuck into it. Full
disclosure, I’m a [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm) fanboy having
bought the course bundle multiple times, and listen to the podcast
often along with [PythonBytes](https://pythonbytes.fm).
