Simon Willison recently [linked][2] to [a post about NotebookLM][1] by
Steven Johnson. I’ve started to get interested in [NotebookLM][4] but
was even more curious about Steven Johnson since I had lost track of a
favorite author [Steven _Berlin_ Johnson][3].

Turns out they were one and the same. Even better, Johnson has been
deeply involved in [the creation and development of NotebookLM][5].
