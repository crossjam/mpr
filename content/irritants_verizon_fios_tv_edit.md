Don't get me wrong. The price point for the Verizon Triple Play was sweet relative to Verizon + DirectTV. But there are a few glitches:

* Leasing the set top boxes for $7 (standard) and $15 (DVR) a month

* The semi-occasional box reboot with the blinkenlights going "FPGA"

* The online listings which are too frequently flat wrong

* The minimal amount of space devoted to metadata for program entries in the online guide

* Lag in bringing up a new channel

I'd been a DirectTV customer for over 6 years, so there's no surprise in a bit of culture shock. Fiber to the curb Internet is still kickass after three though.
