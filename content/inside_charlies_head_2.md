One of the nice things about getting back into reading books is that many authors now blog. I'm monitoring a rather arbitrarily compiled "4 Horsemen of the Scifiblogalypse": <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/index.html">Charles Stross</a>, <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/">John Scalzi</a>, <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>, and <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>.

In <em><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441016685">The Atrocity Archives</a></i></em>, Stross had a lengthy addendum describing how the book was a combination of spy thriller and Lovecraftian horror. Apparently he's working on some follow up novels and the process is ... <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/01/the_lovecraftian_singularity.html">nibbling at the dark corners of his mind</a>. He coins the term <em>Strangelovecraftian</em> to cover the style of horror he'll be further exploring in the Laundry series. Looks like it'll be a blend of the absurdity of Kubrick's <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> and Lovecraft's apocalyptic shuffling things from a cold, dark, alien time. It'll probably be quite funny, in a sick sort of way.

Anyway, it's an interesting look at how an author thinks about shaping an upcoming work. Now I have to go and place an order for the trade paperback of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441016715">The Jennifer Morgue</a></em>.
