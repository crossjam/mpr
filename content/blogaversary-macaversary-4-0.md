Not much to say here. Trucking along at full speed into year five of this blog adventure. I have grown comfortable without [a grand plan][3] and am enjoying just keeping the ride going.

[Happiness][1] is still a warm MacBook, maybe not so new. Think I’ll hold off on a laptop upgrade until something comes along a little closer to [the sweet spot][2]. Plus I’ve got some other clear cut *need* purchases this year, and I definitely *want* an iPhone 5. Besides, [the new toy][4] has been plenty of upgrade for one year.
