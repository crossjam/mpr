The skinny. I went 3-1 over the weekend. My two editions of Doom Patrol are undefeated, tied for first, and looking pretty solid. With some judicious free agent pickups, my NFL.com team is now looking pretty strong. As predicted, Justice Society is giving me a hard time, losing again.

Fantasy football starts to get tricky this week in that real teams are starting to have bye weeks. So some of my fantasy players might not actually be playing.

If you're lucky, you've got a bench stocked with capable subs. However, some positions, like tight end and defense, you just don't bother. In some leagues, you just don't have a lot of bench space, so you have to carefully consider how you'll fill in for a week.

This is also the time of year where fantasy undrafted guys who wind up making a big difference start to emerge. I'm making a big push in many of my leagues to get Pierre Garcon, the #2 receiver of Peyton Manning, and an emerging productive player. Due to injuries to the Cowboys Marion Barber and Felix Jones, Tashard Choice may suddenly be a #1 back on a solid to good team. I scooped him up over the past weekend.

Justice Society is the only downer. This team doesn't really have any no-brainer, explosive players who'll get 20+ fantasy points on a regular basis. So I have to guess at favorable matchups, which is a bit of a crapshoot. I'm contemplating experimenting with trades for this team. Trading hasn't been a favored activity in my previous fantasy systems. If this team ends up with a winning record I'll be surprised.
