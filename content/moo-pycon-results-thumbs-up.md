So I actually did [take advantage][1] of the [promotion][2] that [moo](http://us.moo.com) did with PyCon, providing a 50 business card sample for the cost of shipping. I picked out the whizzy design you see attached, placed the order, chose the eco-friendly card stock, and waited to see the results.

The pickup experience couldn't have been easier. Just asked at the registration desk and boom, right in my hands. The unboxing was pretty cool too. moo has nice wrapping. And ultimately the cards were pretty sweet as well. I think the design I chose probably needs stock that can support a bit higher ink resolution and some gloss for best effect. But for what I paid, $4, I can't really complain. 

Also should have sprung for a cardholder.

So consider me a happy new customer of moo. The PyCon set was mostly whimsical, although I now think Mad Data Scientist LLC (or Inc) might make for a pretty good company name. And having “Mad Data Scientist” on my badge seemed to tickle a few folks. Have to hand out a few more cards and check out some more reactions.
