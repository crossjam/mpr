> hallucinations.

> self-hosting. It’s easy and free to get started. For teams investing
> in a long-term GenAI strategy, Onyx can be easily extended or
> customized to your team’s future needs.

> optimize the experience for your team. Plug and play any LLM model,
> connect only the data you need, and enable the features you want
