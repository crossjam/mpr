[Simon Willison][2] up and [restarted blogging][1]. 

> I may not have blogged in seven years, but I did answer a whole bunch of questions on Quora. I’ve imported my Quora answers (extracted using this userscript) and used them to help fill out the intervening years. I plan to do the same with a few other types of content as well.

That’s one of the benefits of leaving your feedroll alone for the most part. Willison posts just started showing up again in my aggregator. And he’s been really productive with useful technical content. 

Glad you’re back on the case Simon!
