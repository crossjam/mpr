Prismatic was the info feed of last resort behind my RSS feeds in Mr. Reader, Tweetbot, Hacker News in Mobile Safari, and even the Techcrunch iPad app. Not a good position to be in.

Enter [the Prismatic iPhone App][2]. On my iPhone, there’s a little less competition, with Tweetbot out front, and NetNewsWire trailing somewhat in second. I can see iPhone Prismatic filling a nice role of serendipitous discovery beyond my RSS, but not as micro-nugget as Twitter.

The app is very elegantly designed, and has a great unboxing, which is a new *(at least to me)* trend in iOS apps. The only nit I have out of the gate is that it forces alignment of stories on discrete boundaries, which gives inertial scrolling a slightly clunky feel. And the refresh when you hit the bottom of available stories has no indicator, so a fetching pause seems like the app is stuck. In total, not as smooth as my favorite inertial scroller Tweetbot.

But if they’re content curation is as good as they claim it should be, I think I can wait for a bit more polish.
