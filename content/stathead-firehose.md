Statheads tagline is: *Mission: Compile all the sports research you need to know*. It's a good old-fashioned linkblog devoted to quantitative research across all sports. So I threw it in the feedreader.

Not sure it was a good idea, given my recent trimming of fire-hose feeds. Stathead definitely pours out the links on a daily basis and these days I'd rather do more reading and less filtering. But I'll continue the test drive, since there've already been a couple of choice links, and I really want to sink deeper into this area.
