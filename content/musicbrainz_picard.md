During my completist phase of gathering the [Fabric][4] and
[FabricLive][5] digital releases, I wound up with a bunch of `.wav`
files. These files had no metadata, which makes for a crappy playback
experience. I had been mucking around trying to pull something
together using [Discogs data][2] and [`ffmpeg`][3]. Things got complex
way too fast.

So I start digging around for MP3 taggers looking especially at some
of the commercial ones for macOS. Google happened to turn up Picard. I
was a bit skeptical since open source apps and commercial music data
haven’t worked well for me in the past.

Man was I wrong! Picard so far is really good. I’m actually impressed
how well it’s handled metadata for the mix CDs I’ve thrown at it. The
Musicbrainz metadata repository hasn’t been stumped, Picard lines up
data and tracks well, and updating tags is just a button push. Bonus,
cover art gets added properly as well.

Now to be about cleaning up a big pile of mixes recently and not so
recently acquired.
