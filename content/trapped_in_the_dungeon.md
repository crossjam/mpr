Can't ... stop ... playing...<br/>Dieselboy's [*The Dungeonmaster's Guide*][1].

Wink's *Evil Acid (Gridlok Remix)* is beyond sick followed so smoothly into Teebee & Calyx's *Follow The Leader*. Every time I listen to *The Dungeonmaster's Guide* I can't get those bits out of my head for a few hours.

The only blemish is the tail end of the compilation, which get's a little too happy for me, bordering on [Hi-NRG][2]. Sort of spoils the dark themes and flavors at the beginning of the mix. Still, currently it's quite hard to push *The Dungeonmaster's Guide* out of the rotation.
