[TIL][1] the original [Whisper][2] is mostly Python and I was also
introduced to [Sumana Harihareswara][4]

> Whisper, from OpenAI, is a new open source tool that "approaches
> human level robustness and accuracy on English speech recognition";
> "Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well
> as translation from those languages into English." ...

> Whisper is an open source software tool written mostly in the Python

I will definitely be giving this a test drive during my holiday time
off.

Meanwhile, [Harihareswara][5] seems like quite [the interesting
individual][6]. I appreciate her thoughtfulness regarding the ethics
of using Whisper. Will be adding her blog to my feeds.
