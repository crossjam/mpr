Just [a pile of possible interesting presentations][1] on the Python ecosystem from the recent [PyData Seattle conference][2]

> Two day conference on Python, Data, Analytics. Sponsored by Numfocus.org and the Microsoft Python team.

> Delivered by world-renowned authors and technology leaders.

YMMV.
