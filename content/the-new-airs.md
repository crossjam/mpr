Since the Apple url isn't particularly stable, I'll point to [Jacqui Cheng's writeup at ArsTechnica][1] for the specs in human comprehensible form.

If at some point I do take a bite, I'll probably go top shelf and get a maxed out 13 inch edition. Too bad you can't get 8GB of RAM in the things, then it'd be a *fabulous* developer machine. Depending on finances, I'd splurge on the Thunderbolt driven display as well. Although not cheap, that combo would do me for a good 3 to 5 years.
