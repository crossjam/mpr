Title: Challenging

Over a year ago I [mentioned]({filename}python_coding_refresh.md) some
sites to help refresh the Python coding skills. Going on about a year
now, I signed up for the [PyBites community][1] and the
[codechalleng.es][2] platform. Working in fits and starts, I’m now
actually getting back into consistently solving the bites.  Here’s my
[PyBites profile][3]. Climbing the ladder.

Turns out there are curated "learning path" collections of bites,
progressively more difficult. Trying to complete learning paths seems
to be the carrot that gets me going. Now that I’ve chewed up a lot of
the easier bites, I’m definitely hitting the more challenging
ones, those valued for 3 and 4 points. Even though I’m fairly
experienced in Python these take a non-trivial amount of
time. Sometimes it’s just understanding the actual problem statement
but other times I need to put on my thinking cap and solve an
intellectual puzzle, which is great!

Definitely a happy customer and can recommend [codechalleng.es][2] if
you’re looking to build up your Python muscles.
