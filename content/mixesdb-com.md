>Together with their dates, tracklists, file details and flyers a useful collection of artists, events, clubs, and podcasts is built:

> The mixes are added by music lovers from all over the world. Our slogan: We care about correctness because most do not.

> We don't offer any downloads or secret ways to get download links.
