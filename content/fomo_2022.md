Title: Fear of Missing Out 2022

Back in October I had this weird uncharacteristic media buying
splurge. Physical or digital it didn’t matter. Novels, novellas,
short story collections, graphic novels, pamphlets, didn’t
matter. Sports, history, culture, politics, media, tech, didn’t
matter. Training sites, news apps, digital long form magazines,
didn’t matter.

Some of it was authors I like releasing new books that seem really
intriguing. Some of it was recommendations from authors I really
like. Some are from authors I know personally. Some of it was second
order linkage from references. Some of it was deal sniping and some of
it was remainder bin diving. Some of it was stuff I want to
revisit. Some of it was material I always thought I should visit.

At this point, I have so much material I’d be totally happy spending
every waking hour for the rest of the calendar year reading as much as
possible. 

Thankfully I avoided any Black Friday urges and didn’t purchase
anything. Looking forward to Giving Tuesday.
