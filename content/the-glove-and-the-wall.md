I saw a clip right after the announcement and Payton said a couple of interesting things. First, he said he thought of the current crop of players, John Wall had the most potential to equal The Glove **defensively**. Yow! 

Second, Payton said he’d actually been dong some work with Wall. Never quite know what that really means, but it’s a good sign. And I think it’s starting to show in Wall's game.
