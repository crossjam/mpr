TIL a new word, [_cathect_][1]

```
(transitive, psychology) To focus one’s emotional energies on someone
or something.

    * 2013, Carroll E. Izard, Human Emotions, page 193:

        Apparently it is possible for an individual to cathect any
		person, object, idea, or image. Of considerable importance to
		a possible analogy between cathexis and the emotion of
		interest, is Freud’s notion that an individual can cathect
		thought or thinking as well as attention and perception.
		
```
Love it when my vocabulary is expanded.
