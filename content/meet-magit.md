[Jeremy Zawodny on][2] the [*Meet Magit*][1] screencast:
> *“Having seen the video, I find that I most often refer to the Magit Cheatsheet and the Magit User Manual. If you’re an emacs and git user, you probably owe it to yourself to spend 15-20 minutes watching the video and trying out magit. I think you’ll quickly realize how useful it is.”*

That would be me sir. I've been using magit regularly but in the most naive of fashions. So I will be following your suggestion posthaste.
