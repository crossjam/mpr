I know this one is a bit late but I have to get if off my chest.

The collegiate bowl football system is completely corrupt and the bowl season completely sucks. If it wasn't for the pageantry and rivalries of the regular season, I probably wouldn't tune in. My overriding thought during the BCS Championship game, which I constantly channel surfed out of, was "Get this over with, so I can go to bed!"

What makes me say this? To wit the evidence:

* Who's dumbass idea was it to hold the BCS championship game 9 days after New Years? Used to be when New Years Day was done college football was done. I could see an exclusive evening showcase on New Year's Day. I could see the following Monday as a fill in for Monday Night Football. A week later? That's bull!

* [37 days of non-game action][5] for the "student athletes". Don't ever buy that BS when a university president says they're worried about a playoff "unnecessarily extending the season."

* Other than the Rose Bowl, all the other bowls are exposed as dubious exhibitions. [*Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl?*][4] C'mon! And The Grandaddy of Them All is putting its tradition on thin ice with its routine disruption of the Pac-10/Big-10 matchup. The BCS has managed to uniquely ruin the other bowls in the way a playoff couldn't.

* Not apples to apples, but Rich Rodriguez violates NCAA rules and keeps his [multimillion $$ paycheck][8], gets fired, and keeps his [multimillion $$ buyout][9]. [Bruce Pearl **lies** to the NCAA][3], keeps his job, keeps his multimillion $$ paycheck, and only has to sit out a few games. Terrelle Pryor, while working for no pay, unloads a bunch of excess gift crap, gets a 5 game suspension, and his head coach strongarms him into **not** considering a lucrative compensation year and competing in a future earnings deflating season. Guessing Tressel didn't get a fine.

* Cam Newton's dad attempts to pimp him out and somehow it's **not** a violation.

* Bowl directors making [high six figure salaries][2].

* ["This is for all the Tostitos"][1]. I've noticed Brent slipping as well, but really, that sentence was the punctuation on the crappiness of the whole system.

Not that it actually matters, with [ESPN rolling in the ratings][6].

*Ahhhh, that feels better. When's [The Big Game][7] next year?*
