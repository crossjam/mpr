From the [best *(only?!)* post][1] to American McCarver in a while:

> But football is a contest and picking sides is what competition is about. So who does a disinterested party root for this weekend?

> Both teams are populated with terrible human beings, so that doesn’t help. (I’m tempted to give the edge to the Ravens, because at least Ray Lewis knew what he was doing when he denied it later.) The normally reliable heuristic of rooting against a Harbaugh doesn’t work. Colin Kaepernick is the obvious hero from every football movie ever, but nobody should have to cheer for someone with a chin beard. Seriously, Colin, stop taking grooming tips from Brian Wilson.

This is the least interest I’ve had in a Super Bowl since that Denver-Atlanta stinker in 1999. I absentmindedly listened to that one on radio and slept through part of it. In 2013, I have no sympathy for any of the players. As an East Bay aficionado, I can’t stand the ’Niners and their fans. Not to mention their jerk of a former Stanford coach. Even though I have Baltimore ties, the Ravens are the Browns, not the Colts. And Ray Ray’s act and history irk me to no end.

Guess I’ll hold my nose and go for the Ravens just for Ozzie Newsome’s sake.

**Bonus**. [Sapp before Haley?][2] I’m really just starting to dislike the NFL.
