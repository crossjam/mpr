The meeting was surprisingly conveniently located for me and I enjoyed both speakers, even though I only had surface knowledge of the night's topic. The presentations were focused on the [Cassandra][4]  [NoSQL data store][3]. We got an overview of the fresh off the press Cassandra 1.0 release, and some insights into the [CQL query language][5] for Cassandra.

Didn't mind the dive into infrastructure, but I'm more of a straight-up data and analytics guy. Looking forward to more Big Data DC meetups though.
