*Implementing Machine Learning.* Now there’s a title I’d pay for, especially if it focused on modern [graphical models][2]. [*Programming Collective Intelligence*][1] goes part of the way on some of the basic approaches, but filling in the details on the stuff coming out of academic papers would be really helpful.
