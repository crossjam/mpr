Well, I was planning on upgrading my blog to MovableType 5, but they [dumped support for SQLite][1], which was one of my favorite features. Now the default only supports MySQL. If I have to go that route, I'll have to seriously evaluate what blog platform I use. Drag!

*Also, this is a test post for [MarsEdit 3][2].*

*Foo. Doesn't seem to have fixed long posting times. I suspect it's not MarsEdit's fault, but my server side setup.*
