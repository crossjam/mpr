Link parkin, from Trey Hunner’s site: [Python Articles on Cheat Sheets][1]

> A collection of the many Python cheat sheets within Python Morsels
> articles and screencasts.

I especially like the [cheatsheet on the `pathlib` module][2]:

> I now use pathlib for nearly all file-related code in Python,
> especially when I need to construct or deconstruct file paths or ask
> questions of file paths. 

> I'd like to make the case for Python's pathlib module... but first
> let's look at a cheat sheet of common path operations.
