[From][1] the Wired online archives, dated 7/30/2001:

> MIT's Media Lab is experimenting with a tool for indexing the most popular hypertext links across thousands of weblogs and has ambitious plans to turn it into a resource for the mass media.

> Launched last week, Blogdex is like a search-engine spider that visits about 9,000 weblogs a day looking for hypertext links.


Things have changed a bit since then.
