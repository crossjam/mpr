A lot of people complain about the lack of extensions, which is no big deal to me, but the tab navigation control is just not up to snuff. I'm so used to right clicking on a window and being able to resurrect a closed tab, it's muscle memory. Memory that <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> consistently denies.

I may have to switch to Firefox.
