I am **so** doing [this homebrew project][1] over the holidays.

> First, why would you do this? Why not. It's awesome. It's a learning experience. It's cheaper to get 6 pis than six "real computers." It's somewhat portable. While you can certainly quickly and easily build a Kubernetes Cluster in the cloud within your browser using a Cloud Shell, there's something more visceral about learning it this way, IMHO. Additionally, it's a non-trivial little bit of power you've got here. This is also a great little development cluster for experimenting. I'm very happy with the result.

> By the end of this blog post you'll have not just Hello World but you'll have Cloud Native Distributed Containerized RESTful microservice based on ARMv7 w/ k8s Hello World! as a service.
