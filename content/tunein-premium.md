I’m here to recommend [TuneIn Premium][2] as a worthwhile streaming audio product, especially if you like to *listen* to sporting events.

A few years ago, I subscribed to NFL GameDay Audio. $10.00 or so for the whole season. Love streaming audio, let’s me do work while following a game. I don’t completely blow big chunks of Sunday, Monday, and Thursday being a couch potato. Yet I can still track my fantasy team. Perfect price, for a solid product.

GameDay Audio was folded into a comprehensive, video-on-demand, $100 per season package. Only live mobile viewing is on Verizon no less. Not for me.

Last year the NBA had an Audio League Pass product. $10 for the entire season, stream any game. A little wonky, wouldn’t background stream while in the app, but totally enjoyed the product last season. 

At the start of this NBA season, audio streaming was folded into a comprehensive, video-on-demand product that costs $200 for the year. Not to mention, live national games **and** live local games are blacked out. Really for the desperate, out of market fanatic. Not at all useful for me. 

In an online chat, I asked a customer rep if NBA League Pass Audio was coming back this season. The response was no. So of course now it shows up in the [product listings][1]. **Jerks**.

For some reason, I’ve been ignoring [TuneIn Premium’s][2] offerings. This fall I decided to check out the trial offering. Guess what? You get streaming audio access to all of the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, the [English Premier League][3], and pretty much any NCAA Division I sporting event. An annual subscription is $99, or about $8 per month. Not quite as cost effective as the old set of passes, but there’s way more content accessible. 

To the best of my knowledge, the NHL streams audio for free on their app, MLB streams audio for a reasonable price in a great app, the NBA is highly confused about their audio product, and the NFL just doesn’t care. 

So far so good with TuneIn Premium. Like I said, I’m here to recommend [TuneIn Premium][2] as a worthwhile streaming audio product, especially if you like to *listen* to sporting events.
