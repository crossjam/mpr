Glad I got a hold of my [Tweetbot for Mac][2] Alpha before it got [pulled][1]:
> As some of you may have already noticed the download link for the Tweetbot for Mac alpha no longer works. Twitter’s latest API Changes means now we have a large but finite limit on the number of user tokens we can get for Tweetbot for Mac. We’ve been working with Twitter over the last few days to try to work around this limit for the duration of the beta but have been unable to come up with a solution that was acceptable to them. Because of this we’ve decided its best for us to pull the alpha.

I hope I’m using it enough for the Tapbots to get something useful out of my usage.
