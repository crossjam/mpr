<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

### September

* [_Nothing is True and Everything is Possible_][1], Peter Pomerantsev
* [_Survival of the Richest_][2], Douglas Rushkoff
* [_Boomerang_][3], Michael Lewis

_Nothing is True_... is an exploration of Russian life and culture
circa 2014. Told in a series of colorful vignettes from Pomerantsev’s
time in country as a television producer. I was just struck by the
hollowness and emptiness of life in The Federation.

The bookstore and book jacket hook for _Survival of the Richest_ is
survivalist billionaires but the real insight is The Mindset,
which would have been a better title. Unlike other Rushkoff books,
this one has no prescriptions but the naming of the all-consuming
capitalist, techno solutionism mentality will have to suffice.

_Boomerang_ was an entertaining financial triptych across parts of the
world, but ultimately fizzled for me. Winding things up with miserable
municipal proceedings in Vallejo, CA just doesn’t feel commensurate
with the financial destruction on offer. Definitely deserves an
updated, post-pandemic second edition. It is however, quite funny in
spots.

### October

* [_Annihilation_][4], Jeff Vandermeer
* [_This is Not Propaganda_][5], Peter Pomerantsev
* [_Quit_][6] Annie Duke
* [_The Haunting of Tram Car 015_][7], P. Djeli Clark
* [_Black Kiss II_][8], [_Black Kiss 2: XXXmas in July Special_][9],
  Howard Chaykin
  
_Annihilation_ received [a Hollywood treatment][14] featuring Natalie
Portman, a movie which I actually enjoyed and saw before picking up
the book. The novel was quite different and challenging. Mostly inner
monologue and retrospection, I feel like it was great and one of the
best books I’ve read this year, but it’s hard to say why.

I’ve enjoyed all of Annie Duke’s works on thinking about decision
making. _Quit_ also revealed a bit of her backstory on why she was
forced to abandon her doctoral work. Best lesson I took away from
_Quit_ is that (to paraphrase) good quitting, and there is such a
thing as good quitting, typically feels like something was left on the
table.

Pomerantsev followed up _Nothing is True and Everything is Possible_
with a deep dive into global schemes to weaponize misinformation and
manipulative information, particularly in the political sphere. To my
mind, _This is Not Propaganda_ is a bit shallower than _Nothing is
True..._ but maybe that’s only because I’m more informed about this
topic from the tech social media sphere.

_...Tram Car 015..._, a novella, is a nicely done supernatural mystery,
set in an alternative Middle East history and with a feminist
twist. Looking forward to reading more from this author.

The original _Black Kiss_ was amazingly explicit, profane, and
intelligently adult for its time, especially to an impressionable teen
of the era like me. Many decades later, same goes for the _Black Kiss
II_ and the _...XXXmas in July Special_. The former requires careful
rereading while the latter is a quite enjoyable, well crafted revenge
tale.

### November

* [_Makeshift_][10], Gideon Lichfield, ed.
* [_Black Kiss_][11], Howard Chaykin
* [_The Aleph_][12], Jorge Luis Borges

_Makeshift_ is a short story collection by a number of accomplished
speculative fiction writers with a theme of post-pandemic visions. All
are worth reading, many are quite good. _A Necessary Being_ by
Indrapramit Das really stuck with me. More climate change fiction than
post-pandemic, the character and relationship development is amazing.

Had to go back and read the original _Black Kiss_ which still holds up
quite well. As is usual with a Chaykin work, once you’re finished you
want to go back and reread the early issues to realign your
understanding and rediscover things overlooked. Gets a little rushed
at the end as too many threads need to be tied off, but definitely a
visually distinctive, filthy, and fun ride.

What can one say about [Jorge Luis Borges][13] other than profound
admiration for the way he can mix the fantastic and the philosophical?
Of a different time, yet all times, each story will engage your focus,
surprise you, and ultimately challenge how you think.
