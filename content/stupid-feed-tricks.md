I was amused by Brent Simmons’ [republishing of Brian Reischl’s *Stupid Feed Tricks*][1]
> Brian is intimately acquainted with the different ways feeds can be screwed up. So he posted Stupid Feed Tricks on Google Docs.

> I quote the entire thing below for people like me who don’t have Google accounts. The below is all by Brian:
>> …
>> Putting a tiny number of posts in the feed (sometimes just one). These types then usually publish 10 articles in the space of two minutes, and wonder why you’re missing 9 of them.
>> …

Now ponder scaling these issues up to *(tens?, hundreds?)* millions of feeds and users and you can see the challenge facing anyone providing a Google scale feed synch ecosystem.

Also, don’t miss Brent’s [favorite way to screw up a feed][2]. Really, hotel connectivity needs to die a horrible death at the hands of 4G and LTE. Conference provisioning is “only” way overpriced. Lodger oriented is overpriced and busted. 

*Ahhh the wonders of the Web. Thankfully, it’s the least worst, global, open, networked, hypermedia system we have.*
