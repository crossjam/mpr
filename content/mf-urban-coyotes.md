Now I can stop [complaining][2]. My [Mark Farina, *Urban Coyotes* CD][1] is physically in hand. This is the first physical CD I’ve bought since Farina’s *Mushroom Jazz 7* and I haven’t even downloaded much over the past year and a half. So I’m looking forward to getting something new in the mix. Don’t have time to rip it tonight, but it’ll be on the Jesusphone 5 posthaste.
