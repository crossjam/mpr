[Rafe Colburn is bullish on NewsBlur][1] as a replacement for Google Reader, especially after [the recent redesign][2]:
> The upside of NewsBlur has been that it works really well at its core purpose, fetching feeds and displaying them for the user. It also has solid native mobile clients, enabling you to keep read status in sync across devices.

That’s a good enough endorsement for me. With the clock ticking on [the GReader shutdown][3], I’ll give NewsBlur the first crack at filling the void for me.
