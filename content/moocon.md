Just for the heck of it, I was considering getting some cards from [MOO][2] to hand out when I attended PyCon. I’ve got spiffy cards from work but this is a personal trip. Looks like a few other folks had the same idea, MOO caught wind of the trend, and now they’re running [a PyCon special on MOOcards][1]. Nice touch delivering directly to the conference for pickup.
