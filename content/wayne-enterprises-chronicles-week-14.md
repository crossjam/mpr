Onwards to the Fantasy Playoffs!!

The matchup was unnecessarily tense in that I started RGIII (17.47 points) over Cam Newton (39.17 points). Given the weather, rainy, and opponent, Ravens, I was seriously leaning towards benching Griffin. Instead I went with the “don’t get cute” mantra. Similarly, I went with an oversold Greg Jennings instead of reliable Randall Cobb.

Thankfully, I made a great waiver wire pickup in Knowshon Moreno for 24 points. And no one else underperformed. Thankfully Arian Foster collected just enough garbage time points to get me over the hump. A five point squeaker that had me sweating into the second half of Monday Night Football.

Feeling good about my playoff chances although my opponent has some scary explosive players in Josh Freeman (hot, good matchup), Torrey Smith (overdue), Calvin Johnson (he’s Megatron), and Adrian Peterson (’nuff said). I’m guessing I’ll need someone to go way over projection to pull this one out.
