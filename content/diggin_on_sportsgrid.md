[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Sports Grid Logo.png" alt="Sports Grid Logo.png" border="0" width="100" height="48" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />](http://sportsgrid.com) It's about two weeks since I [discovered SportsGrid][1], but I'm really enjoying their reportage. I especially liked their [NCAA football coverage][2] while the [Big 12 was melting dow][3] ... **errr** ... [reconfiguring][4]. Again, I have to point out [SportsGrid](http://sportsgrid.com), while having a slightly irreverent tone, is simply not as juvenile as [DeadSpin](http://deadspin.com). The only irritant is their usage of "WATCH" in every post that features a video embed.

*Highly recommended.*
