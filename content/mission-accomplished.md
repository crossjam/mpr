With the help of an iFixit [YouTube video][1] and [repair Guide][2], I managed to complete the upgrading of Ye Olde MacBook [as previously advertised][3]. Unfortunately, the guide delivered with the [MCE OptiBay ][4] seems specific to MacBook Pros, with no info for us old MacBook peasants. The iFixit material did in a pinch though. Way more tiny screws were involved than I planned, but the machine currently seems none the worse for the experience. 

Now I need to put the HD through it’s paces a little, making it the home of my iTunes Library. But I feel good this little MacBook can make it to its fifth anniversary and well beyond.
