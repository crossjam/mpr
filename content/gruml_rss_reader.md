As an ardent feed reader fan, I'm always on the lookout for new reading software. [Via LifeHacker][2] I heard about [Gruml][1], a new reader that is specifically aimed to be a desktop adjunct to [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com). Since I love Google Reader this looks very interesting.

Now of course on the Mac it's going to be difficult to pry [NetNewsWire][3] out of my hands, but there is one potential chink. I **really** love Google Reader's keyboard navigation, `j/k/n/p` for navigating items and their shift equivalents for traversing feeds/groups, is brilliant. If there's one thing that truly bugs me about NetNewsWire is that once you're in an item, I haven't found a keyboard gesture to get back to item/feed navigation. Also, in NetNewsWire while the arrow keys are equivalent to `j/k/n/p` on my MacBook they take my fingers away from the home row. Just a touch of friction that slows me down.

So I'll give Gruml a try on a tertiary Google Reader account, and see how it goes.
