_Hola Peeps!_ 

It’s been a moment. The archives record my last post was late
September, 2023. Yikes! Suffice to say quite a bit happened after I
mentioned [going on sabbatical]({filename}/back-in-the-saddle.md),
(**TL;DR** elderly dad got ill and needed a lot of assistance getting
back on his feet ; an extended, elaborate, distracting recruiting
process for an intriguing employment position fell through) but I
survived. Can’t say I achieved what I set out to, but life hits you
with a curve ball every now and then.

The last month or so I’ve really started to get back into my own
personal technical diversions. Any longtime followers will have a good
idea what that entails. Of course, I’ll have to write about them,
although fair warning, I’ll also be messing about quite a bit with
experimental publishing to other sites I own. More to come.

To the title of this particular post. Between [Mass Programming
Resistance](https://mpr.crossjam.net) and [New Media
Hack](https://nmh.crossjam.net) I’ve pushed out at least a few blogs
every year since January 18 2003. Employing my overeducated abilities,
this one will extend the streak to 22 years in a row. 😲 Definitely
bursty, but it’s some sort of an accomplishment. Many other bloggers,
prominent or not, have fallen by the wayside. Just says I’m something
of an Internet old-timer. _If they only knew._

Having been through a few social media eras, and not really into
TheSocials (tm) of this moment, I plan to keep plugging away at this
here site, passing along nuggets and commenting on various and sundry
that catches my eye. Definitely good therapy.

To 20 more years. Forza!
