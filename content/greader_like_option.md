Now there's an option to only see them from people you follow. Well, since I don't follow anyone in Reader, this is effectively an off switch for me. Which is just fine and dandy.

In other feed reader news, [NewsGator shutdown NewsGator Online][2] it's webbased feed aggregator. Not exactly earthshaking given their current market focus. However on a more interesting note, their desktop clients, [including NetwNewsWire][3], now synch with Google Reader.
