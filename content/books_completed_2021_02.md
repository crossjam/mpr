Still making quite good progress on the book reading front. Herewith
is the list of completed texts from this June. Just for
posterity’s sake.

* [_Fear and Loathing in La Liga_][1], Side Lowe
* [_The Club_][2], Joshua Robinson, Jonathan Clegg
* [_Atomic Habits_][3], James Clear
* [_Good Strategy, Bad Strategy_][4], Richard Rumelt
* [_The Lathe of Heaven_][5], Ursula K. Le Guin
* [_The Bayern Agenda_][6], Dan Moren

_The Lathe of Heaven_  pleasantly reminded me of how beautiful Le
Guin’s writing can be. Some excellent passages in that book.

_Fear and Loathing ..._ is not only a football book but a history
book. Learned a lot about Spain.

My only appointment sports viewing is the English Premier League,
whose birth and rise is documented in _The Club_. As a relative
newcomer to football, Clegg and Robinson filled in a lot of gaps in my
knowledge. It’s actually sort of amazing (to me) in what bad shape
English football was in just 30 years ago. In my mind, the Premier
League had just been this historically monstrous behemoth. Not so fast
...

_Good Strategy, Bad Strategy_ is an excellent business book. 10 years
old now, it’s also interesting from a tech perspective because it uses
NVIDIA as a case study **before** the company’s recent AI/ML fueled
surge.

_Atomic Habits_ does what it says on the tin and actually provides
concrete actionable techniques for constructing enduring positive
habits.

Two football books, two science fiction books, and two personal
development(ish) books turned out to be a nice mix. I’m trying to
replicate that during July.

Thirteen confirmed completions for the year. Thirty total is within
reach.
