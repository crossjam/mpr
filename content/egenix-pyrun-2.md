[eGenix PyRun][1] looks like it might come in handy some day.

> Our new eGenix PyRun™ combines a Python interpreter with an almost complete Python standard library into a single easy-to-use executable, that does not require a system wide installation and is fully relocatable.

> eGenix PyRun's executable only needs 11MB, but still supports most Python application and scripts - and it can be further compressed to 3-4MB using gzexe or upx.

> Compared to a regular Python installation of typically 100MB on disk, this makes eGenix PyRun ideal for applications and scripts that need to be distributed to many target machines, client installations or customers.
