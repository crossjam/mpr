I wasn't holding out much hope, as I thought Apple would have all the iTunes formats and data on lockdown.

Apparently I was wrong. You can write your own custom player for iOS that taps into the users iTunes database. Seems to be a plethora of such apps in the iTunes music store.

So I'm giving the rather garish [Amp Music Player][1] a test drive. At the very least, it seems to do a better job of making track metadata visible. But the overly busy interface doesn't seem quite right coming from the music app. We'll see how it goes.
