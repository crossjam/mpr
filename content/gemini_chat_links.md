Author: C. Ross Jam

Since I just put the chat link feature of Gemini, thought it might be
a good idea to ask [how long the links last][1]. And who better to
query then Gemini!

If I’d have figured this out earlier, I’d have used a Gemini link in
my [discussion][2] of mixes and streaming platforms. Which reminds me
to check in and see how to do this with ChatGPT and Claude.
