Actually, I'm a bit remiss since this was the Bear's first [solo championship in 50 years][1]. That's a pretty Big F* Deal! Not to mention they swept Stanford to clinch. Hope this is a sign we'll get that Rose Bowl trip in my lifetime.

The Bears are off to a good postseason start, smacking around the Oregon Ducks in [an easy 90-74 victory][2] to start off their Pac-10 Tourney. Given how they closed out the regular season with convincing wins, under a little pressure, maybe they're gearing up for a deep run in the NCAA tourney.

Still weird though to think that Mike Montgomery is the head coach.

On other fronts, the Georgetown [Hoyas took out Syracuse][3] in the quarterfinals of the Big East tourney. That'll be a nice one to stoke the rivalry. With Greivis Vasquez and the surprising Maryland Terrapins getting in on the action tomorrow, this could be a pretty good rootin' week in these here parts. And to think, last year the Hoyas fell off a cliff to end the season, and there were rumblings that the game had passed Gary Williams by.
