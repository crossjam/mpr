Forgot how enjoyable the track *Elementary* was:
> DJ Scott LaRock and I: KRS-One  
Our mother's first son and no, we'll never run  
From complex situations like you T-O-Y-S's  
Always talkin junk, yet in jail, you're rockin dresses  
I have arrived for the purpose of joy  
Unlike any ordinary Bronx b-boy  
I will volunteer my services and launch an attack  
On you fake educators with your yakety-yak  

Great beat too.
