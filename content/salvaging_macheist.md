Previously I had mentioned that I was [disappointed with MacHeist][2]. Turns out that after they made their sales target there was a hidden bonus: [Tweetie][1].

Tweetie's a minimalist Mac desktop Twitter client. So far I've enjoyed using it instead of [Brizzly](http://brizzly.com). Obviously Brizzly has the advantage that you can get to it from anywhere you have a browser. Tweetie though demonstrates how much more elegant a desktop app can be than a web one. I may just stick with Tweetie.
