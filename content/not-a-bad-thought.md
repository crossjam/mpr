Maybe [Yahoo! could pick up the ball][1] that Google Reader will be dropping:

> But Yahoo now has a huge opportunity to make itself relevant again to the types of consumers who wrote the company off long ago. Now that Yahoo is referring to itself as a tech company rather than a media firm, it can bolster its techie cred with a product that provides utility that Google won't match.

I say it’s not a bad thought because Yahoo! probably still has enough engineering talent and infrastructure to execute on this at scale. Mashable *(really Todd Wasserman)* misses an even bigger opportunity in that a small team could clone the unofficial GReader API and provide an alternative feed synching ecosystem. That would really be hot for mobile.
