I’ve always said truly great players often seem to have explosive nights, early in their careers, that **really** demonstrate their potential. Think Jordan lighting up the Celtics for 63 and juking Larry Bird in a first round playoff loss in Jordan’s rookie season. Not 100% true, took a while for Steve Nash to get going, but I bet there’s a high correlation.

John Wall’s not quite there yet, but 47 points, with 8 assists, in carrying a decimated Wizards to victory over a good Grizzlies team is a solid sign. And that so quickly after torching the Lakers at Staples.

There’s hope here in DC.
