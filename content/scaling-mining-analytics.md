Just a quick scan of [Jimmy Lin’s paper *(PDF Warning)*][1] hints that there are some useful insights regarding logging at scale, which is currently an interest of mine:
> A little about our backgrounds: The first author is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland who spent an extended sabbatical from 2010 to 2012 at Twitter, primarily working on relevance algorithms and analytics infrastructure. The second author joined Twitter in early 2010 and was first a tech lead, then the engineering manager of the analytics infrastructure team. Together, we hope to provide a blend of the academic and industrial perspectives—a bit of ivory tower musings mixed with “in the trenches” practical advice. Although this paper describes the path we have taken at Twitter and is only one case study, we believe our recommendations align with industry consensus on how to approach a particular set of big data challenges.
