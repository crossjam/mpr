I'm not a mega-baseball fan, but being a red-blooded American sports junkie, I definitely at least pretend to follow the races. In many years, I do a pretty good job, but the DC area teams, the Washington Nationals and the Baltimore Orioles, are so bad all enthusiasm is drained by the end of May. Since the Rays made the World Series recently, the Pirates and maybe the Royals are the only other organizations on a comparable level of incompetence to the Nats and Os.

So this year, I'm forsaking my boyhood team, the Orioles, and officially adopting the Chicago White Sox. Eight years living in Chicago, marrying a South Sider, and being a Chicago resident for the only World Series in the last century (Sox 2005), should be sufficient ante.

On another baseball note, once upon a time I speculated that [Baseball Prospectus wouldn't be able to sustain a subscription based model](http://crossjam.net/nmh/archives/000002.html). Whoops! Missed on that one.
