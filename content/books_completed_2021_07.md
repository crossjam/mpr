_Still mopping up some 2021 odds and ends._

* [_A World Without Email_][1], Cal Newport
* [_Goal: The Ball Doesn’t Go In By Chance_][2], Ferran Soriano

Well, November turned out to be a dismal completion month. Thought I
was going to make a lot of progress during the Thanksgiving holiday,
but that turned out to be a dud. With 35 down for the year, I can at
least still get to 40 hopefully. More after the break.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The thesis of _A World Without Email_ is that technology in the
workplace has encouraged a hyper attentive, hyper responsive, _hive
mind_ way of collaboration. We just fell into this mode and it’s
counterproductive from a both a productivity perspective and emotional
health perspective. Definitely agree with his premise, and being a
long time fan, I enjoyed how Newport constructed the argument and
actionable steps to remedy the issues.

_Goal_ was interesting because it’s a management book written by an
executive, [Ferran Soriano][3], who participated in one of the
greatest runs of club football ever. He, along with plenty of others,
built FC Barcelona into a legendary side that held **every** title
available to a single club team at one time. This slim tome is fun
because all the famous soccer names are just a sidelight to an inside
look on how the Barca management team thought and executed during this
period to create a global superclub. One formula for building
a winning team stuck with me: (commitment * balance)^talent.

Also, as a fan of Manchester City, where Soriano is now, it’s
interesting to see some hypothetical concepts floated in _Goal_ put to
action at City.
