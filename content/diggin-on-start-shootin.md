A few months ago, I was futzin’ around with [Shazam][2] to trainspot a particular song regularly played at Washington Wizards games. *Don’t ask.* I just happened to be killing time at a cafe and a really intriguing track popped up. Whip out the phone, bust out the app, and voilà, [*Start Shootin’ (Little People’s Americana Remix)*][1] is etched in my memory. 

**PEOPLE! WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED OF THIS TRACK IN A TIMELY FASHION!!**

I am a damn sucker for a cut with killer piano and phat beats. The non-remix version works as well, a little more atmospheric and a little less urgent. Too bad [Little People’s][3] output has tailed off. Thank goodness both versions are available on Spotify so I can listen to my heart’s content.

Oddly enough, this is exactly the same way I discovered [Tosca’s *Rondo Acapricio*][4].
