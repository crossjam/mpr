[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/iStats Menu Capture.png" alt="iStats Menu Capture.png" border="0" width="267" height="25" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] The fine folks at [Bjango](http://bjango.com) have updated [iStat Menus][1]. There's [a whole raftload of improvements and fixes][2] for my favorite Macintosh status monitoring tool. Unobtrusively located in my menu bar, iStat menus does its job efficiently and quietly.

Two of the major changes appear to be that first iStat Menus is no long donationware. If you want a license, ante up $10. Second, instead of a preference pane, configuration is now done through a full fledged application. Seems reasonable to me, although [over at Macworld][3], a few folks seem upset.

Also, even though it looks abandoned, [iStat Pro][4] is a nice Dashboard widget version of the monitors in iStat Menus.
