No way I can finish in the money in my bracket pool, so now I have completely free rooting reign in this weekend's Final Four. Besides being the underdogs, here's why I'm rooting for the Butler Bulldogs:

* As a long time Maryland Terrapins fan, *not exclusively though*, I can never root for Duke.

* Since Michigan State put Maryland out this year, can't root for the Spartans

* Never did cotton to Bob Huggins. His programs always struck me as skirting that thin limit of giving sketchy guys opportunities and flat out cheating.

By process of elimination, that leaves Butler. Against a full staffed Michigan State team, they'd probably be prohibitive underdogs, but with the Spartans nicked up they might have a shot of making it to the finals.

Frankly, I'm really fiending for some NBA playoff action. A little over two weeks to go before the stakes get serious in the Western Conference. The Eastern Conference has potential for some excitement (c.f. [Bull-Celtics 2009][1]), but the marquee is the Orlando-Cleveland rematch.
