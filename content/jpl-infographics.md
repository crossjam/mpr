The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Information Programs site [describes][1] the new [JPL Infographics][2] site:
> JPL Infographics, a newly launched website and resource database from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is inviting space aficionados and graphic wizards to take on a visual challenge by grabbing NASA data and transforming them into a scientific work of art.

> The website provides extensive collections of NASA science and mission data, graphics, and space images that members of the public can download and use to create their own infographics — creative illustrations of complex data. Users can upload their infographics, have them reviewed by JPL experts, and share their creations in a public gallery on the JPL website.

Free data, a task, and a place for feedback. Nice work JPL.
