About two years ago, I was lucky enough to catch Christopher Nolan's [*The Dark Knight*][2] at the [Udvar-Hazy Airbus IMAX Theater][3]. This was after missing the flick on it's first run in the theater. And failing to see it in the downtown DC [screen at the Air and Space Museum][4] because it sold out. And passing again when it came to Udvar-Hazy because I thought it would cost $12 for parking, doubling the price of the film. Thankfully, *The Dark Knight* made a return engagement.

The great thing about Udvar-Hazy is that

1. It's a full fledged IMAX screen, not the watered down mall version.

2. They don't do commercials or trailers. When it's starting time, the movie you paid for starts.

3. At least when I went, the venue was way undersold, so me and about 10 other fine folks got the theater to ourselves. Imagine the lush IMAX rendition of Gotham City completely filling your visual field.

4. Don't be fooled by the Udvar-Hazy posted parking restrictions, parking is free after hours.

5. It's an easy 20 minute ride from my house.

Needless to say, I'm completely stoked that [*Inception*][1] is making [an engagement at Udvar-Hazy][5]. A lot of folks seem to like the movie, while there's a vocal segment who don't. Whatever the case may be, seeing it on a massive IMAX screen will be an interesting experience.
