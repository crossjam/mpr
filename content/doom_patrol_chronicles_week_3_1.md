Ugly? With a 25 point spread? I had to sweat out the Monday night game against the Green Bay defense and kicker. Yeah, it was a slim probability of defeat, but weirder things have happened.

Tom Brady did a great job as usual and the Titans' Chris Johnson returned to form. Their combined 51 points were enough to buoy the mediocrity of the rest my team. No other players made it to double digits.

My opponent had a similar day, except only Tony Romo overperformed. Ray Rice made double digits, but underperformed.

Thanks to another underwhelming week, I'm giving up on Calvin "Megatron" Johnson. I was sort of suspicious when I drafted him as my first wide receiver, but thought the Lions might be better this year. Matt Stafford's nursing another injury, the Lions look bad again, and Johnson has had three bad fantasy performances. See you on the waiver wire buddy.

I learned my lesson last season. Cut bait on name brands quick, before they cost you a game.
