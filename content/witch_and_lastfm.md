Being a window switcher, Witch relies on applications to report their open windows. If an individual app is slow then Witch feels slow. [Last.fm](http://last.fm) does not play nice in this regard.

Thanks to the Witch user forums, I discovered this issue and found that you can have Witch ignore certain apps. [Skipping Last.fm leads to normal zippy behavior](http://help.manytricks.com/index.php/topic,26.0.html) in Witch. I'm posting about the solution mainly so that it can better surface in Google.
