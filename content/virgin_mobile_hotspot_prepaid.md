**Interesting.** Virgin Mobile is about to [sell a 3G MiFi Hotspot][1]. Big deal you say? Just like Verizon, AT&T and Sprint, whoopedo! First up, no long term contract after you buy the device for $150. Second, it looks like you'll be able to purchase megabytes using pre-paid cards.

I've been thinking that one of the major hang-ups I have with the HTC Evo is the extra $30 a month for WiFi hotspotting. But really, how badly do I need that feature? The Virgin Mobile offering is a reasonable compromise for someone like me where usage is probably mostly bursty, especially relative to the [Clear 4G+][2], which carries a $40 per month post-paid fee.
