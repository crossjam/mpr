Gee, guess [I called that one][1]. If I didn’t know better I would have thought Manchester City executed their [highwire snatching of defeat from the jaws of victory then victory from the jaws of defeat][2], just to explicitly taunt their Mancunian neighbors. Of course they might have killed a fan or two of their own in the process. A more fitting cherry on top of the Premiership season would have been harder to script, what with The Citizens going into stoppage time to score two goals and rescue their campaign from ignominy. Time had literally run out on the season before they came back from the dead yet again.

Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see the match live as I was out and about for Mother’s Day. Driving through DC and constantly checking the iPhone for updates is not particularly safe, I can confirm. I’m hoping ESPN goes Instant Classic with the broadcast or there’s an on-demand recording available.
