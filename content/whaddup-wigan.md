This now puts 3rd place in play, bringing Arsenal back within range of Tottenham and Newcastle United. Chelsea remains right behind both, but at 2 more points back they don’t look like contenders for third. Thanks Wigan Athletic for putting some excitement into the end of the Premier League campaign.

Now off to watch my DVR of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in The Champions League. I really wish there was a good option for getting the Bundesliga on Verizon FiOS.
