In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been using the iPad **much** more to post to this here blog. The lack of images is a pretty good tell. [I was hoping][4] the [WordPress for iOS][3] application would improve in its most recent release. The actual text editing is seriously irritating, requiring too many modal changes. And the new version has borked my post preview.

Time to start looking for alternatives. An [older review][1] of [Blogsy][2] is encouraging. Looks like they’re a bit more image friendly.
