Very convenient. I’ve been on the lookout for an approach to integrating geospatial information processing into Hadoop. Looks like ESRI is open sourcing some [GIS Tools for Hadoop][1]:
> Data that includes location, and that is enhanced with geographic information in a structured form, is often referred to as Spatial Data. Doing Analysis on Spatial data requires an understanding of geometry and operations that can be preformed on it. Enabling Hadoop to include spatial data and spatial analysis is the goal of this Esri Open Source effort.

> GIS Tools for Hadoop is an open source toolkit intended for Big Spatial Data Analytics. The toolkit provides different libraries:

The libraries:

* [Esri Geometry API for Java][2]
* [Spatial Framework for Hadoop][3]
* [Geoprocessing Tools for Hadoop][4]
