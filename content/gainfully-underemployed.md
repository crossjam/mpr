A long time ago [I vowed][1] to kill my commute. I was a bit off on predicting the closing date, but it’s looking like that time has really arrived. In spades.

I’ll save the details for another post, but last Friday I out processed at the previous gig. The next position is located between 10 and 15 minutes of driving from my house, with no interstate highways to travel. There’s also a lot of schedule flexibility and plenty of opportunity to work from home.

And to top it all off, I have enough runway and flexibility to not start until after the 4th of July. Looking at a good two months where I completely drive the daily activities, modulo family obligations. Herewith, some things that I plan to at least initiate with the time off and thence establish momentum and habits:

* Spend more time with family
* Initiate and maintain an exercise routine
* Read more books
* Blog more
* Move this blogging infrastructure to a more modern hosted VPS
* Modernize my development skills by well, actually writing code, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and unlimbering my distributed version control (DVCS, read Git) skills
* Catch up with the [“cloud native” ecosystem][4] including [Kubernetes][1], [Docker][6], [NATS][5], etc.
* Really get into [Jupyter][2] ecosystem
* Reintroduce myself to some old big data friends like [Spark][7], [Kafka][8], [AWS][9], and [GCP][10]
* ...

Definitely ambitious and not exhaustive. Feels like a lot to do, so I better get to it.
