_Now in the process of mopping up leftover 2021 posts. Don’t know why
I didn’t hit publish on this back in October. At least I was smart
enough to not bake the month into the post title._

* [_Grendel Omnibus, Volume 3_][1], Matt Wagner, et. al.
* [_All Systems Red_][2], Martha Wells
* [_Futebol_][5], Alex Bellos
* [_Getting to Yes_][4], Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton
* [_Remote Control_][3], Nnedi Okorafor

Just a solid month of October. 2021 completed total bumps to 33. Could
actually make a stretch goal of 50 this year. More after the break.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

_Grendel Omnibus, Volume 3_ contains Matt Wagner’s _The Devil and God_
arc. This is one of the most impactful creative pieces encountered in
my entire life. It’s stuck with me since high school. Just a beautiful
and beautifully executed work. Only disappointment is that the
original, amazing, single issue covers couldn’t be
included. Meanwhile, I basically grew out of comics after those issues
were published, so the Orion’s Reign / Grendel Kahn saga was new to
me. The last couple of episodes were ... interesting. Wagner has such
a fabulous ear and eye for the contradictions, hypocrisies, and
venalities of power.

_All Systems Red_ is the first in a much heralded series of novellas
and one novel. The key draw is getting into the head of a non-human
intelligence. Intriguing but not earth shattering for me at the end of
the day. 

_Futebol_ was a well done collection of newspaper or magazine feature
length articles regarding the entanglement of Brazil’s history,
culture, and football.  As a collection there didn’t seem to be much
of an organizing principle like a cast of characters or a window in
time. This is my first read of material covering Brazil so I don’t
want to take it as gospel. But boy, do those Brazilians seem crazy
about football.

_Getting to Yes_, from the well respected Harvard Negotiation Project,
provides a nice framework for conducting negotiations successfully,
presumably. Need to put into application myself for confirmation.n The
top level nugget is to focus on interests as opposed to positions,
where interests abstractly means needs, desires, concerns, and
fears. Focusing on interests may lead to discovering that there might
not actually be conflicting goals and/or open up the process to
creative solutions.

_Remote Control_ is a beatiful novella of [africanfuturism][6]. The
story of a little girl turned death dealer by alien(?) technology and
forced to wander the continent, at many points my heart was racing
awaiting what would happen next. And there were a few achingly sad
moments. I can praise it as having many sentences I wish I had
written.

I’m now realizing that I’m searching for a new (to me), speculative
fiction author that can move the needle in terms of plot, character
development, dialogue, and writing style. My next William Gibson or
Ken Liu. Novellas and short story collections are a good way to go
about it.
