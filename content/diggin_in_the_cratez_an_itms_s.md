Here's why:

1. Selection is pretty poor. I can count on one hand online service, mixed products that are new to me that I've really enjoyed.

2. Even if I find a mix I might like, it's often delivered as one big MP3 or AAC wad. No track separation or playlist information, just one big song. Granted getting an hour+ of music for $0.99 radically increases the amount of music you get per dollar, but a mix is not just one song.

3. To top it off occasionally there are tracks of the mix that aren't available through the service. That might be fine for a traditional album where the track was a stinker, but the absence sort of puts a big pothole in the middle of a mix.

Instead I'll use the iTMS to reconnect to my mid 80's to mid 90's Hip-Hop roots and build a library of nostalgic singles and then progress into the modern era. In this case, I'm much more singles oriented making for a better match with the iTMS. Cherry picking the best one or two tracks off of any Hip-Hop album seems to be a good strategy. Even better is the fact that the iTMS seems to have captured a lot of the B-sides and special releases of the era.

For example, [Ice Cube's](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ice+Cube) [*Amerikkka's Most Wanted*](http://www.discogs.com/release/1045755) is a Hip-Hop classic. On the iTMS, the "album" has 23 tracks, five more than the original vinyl and CD albums. More importantly the bonus tracks include *Jackin' For Beats*, which only appeared on the relatively rare [*Kill at Will*, ep](http://www.discogs.com/Ice-Cube-Kill-At-Will/release/229928). *Jackin For Beats* is a straight up 3 minute romp through some of the classic beats of the time, covered by one of Ice Cube's better rhyme stylings.
