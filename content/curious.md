Completely unscientific, coming from my mother-in-law’s basement in Palos Heights, Illinois, using [speedtest.net][1]:

* iPhone 5, AT&T LTE, 8.5 Mbps down, 0.9 up
* iPad 3gen, Verizon LTE, 24.2 Mbps down, 15.8 up
* iPhone 5, Comcast XFinity Wi-Fi, 0.5 Mbps down, 2.5 up

The XFinity pipe might be carrying the burden of IPTV on the cable box, but doesn’t seem like it’s living up to its billing. Upside is there’s no explicit bandwidth cap.

Verizon Wow!!
