Andray Blatche’s stint as a Washington Wizard has ended. The Basketball Jones, alomg with some mildly amusing commenters, makes [appropriate fun of the occasion][1]:
> As you can see, the Andray Blatche market is pretty dried up. There are even rumors that the Bucks’ original bid would have included an additional three pounds of mozzarella string cheese, but they pulled that because they didn’t think he was worth it. Tough break, but I’m sure the $23 million will cheer him up.

Looking back I’m less disappointed with Blatche then the last remaining piece of failure, Ernie Grunfeld. Andray was just a 29th pick, straight out of high school, project that hasn’t panned out. It was Grunfeld who made the decision to ridiculously overpay him.

And let’s be clear, I was pretty disappointed with Andray.
