Nelson Minar has some [high praise][2] for the [eyeo Festival][1]. Back when she was less well known, I had the pleasure of meeting Fernanda Viégas at a session of the [Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science][3]. *Tough work if you can get it.* Fernanda in the house is a sign of a top notch event. eyeo sounds like a confab I should make it a point to attend before it gets overrun.
