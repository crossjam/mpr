A long time ago, I was an amateur comic book collector. In a tale
soon to be told, I recently purchased an 11" iPad Pro. I don’t really
want to get back into buying physical comic books, but I’m interested
in revisiting some of the classics and reading some recent critically
acclaimed works.

Enter [Comixology Unlimited][1]. [Comixology][2] itself is a venerable
digital comics service that got hoovered up by Amazon a few years
back. The basic idea is that there’s a Comixology reader available
across multiple devices (Web, iOS, Kindles, etc.). You buy digital
versions, to own, of graphic novels and single issues through the
Comixology platform. The Unlimited part is straight from the Amazon
playbook, a monthly subscription service for a lending library that
provides access to a large(?) catalog of titles. The library is a
subset of titles available on the entire platform and there’s a
relatively generous limit on the number of works you can have
"borrowed" at any given time.

In the initial one week trial, I discovered old favorites such as
[_Starstruck_][5], [_V for Vendetta_][6], [_Watchmen_][7], [_Swamp Thing_][8], and
[_Grendel_][9] were available. In particular, there are omnibus versions
available for quite the binge reading opportunity. Even though I’ve
sort of outgrown the superhero tropes, there’s enough Marvel and DC
stuff available to be useful. For example, I went and plowed through
Marvel’s [_The Infinity Gauntlet_][3] limited series, which provides
some of the conceptual foundations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
blockbusters _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_. There’s
no way I’d ever shell out to buy _The Infinity Gauntlet_ on a
permanent basis, but it was fun to read as a rental.

The clincher was getting sucked into [the first omnibus of Matt
Wagner’s _Grendel_][4]. This was a collection of issues that I
personally collected when they first came out, amplified by two
graphic novels that were released well after I stopped
collecting. I’ve always had a soft spot for _Grendel_ and this was the
best of both worlds. Something old and something new to me.

It all comes together with the iPad as a great reading
device. Confessing here that my eyesight ain’t what it was. Comixology
has this really well done Guided View, that zooms into panels making
it easier on these aging eyes to deal with the tiny fonts in ultra
dense works like _Grendel_ (_Starstruck_ being the apex here). And
bonus on picking up lots of art details buried in the background.

Comixology is looking like a subscription worth paying for.
