It's a great open source effort to capture artist discographies and album listings in obsessive, gory detail.

<a href="http://discogs.com/">Discogs.com</a> actually solved a decade old mystery for me. Living in the SF Bay Area in '94, and partaking heavily of the underground house music scene, I moved into the modern era and started buying dj mix cds. One of the earliest, maybe even the first, was <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Louie+Vega">Little Louie Vega's</a> <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Little-Louis-Vega-United-DJs-Of-America-Vol-2-New-York-City/release/3914"><em>United DJs of America, V2: New York City</em></a>. I wore that thing out and still enjoy listening to it 14 years after its release. The build and release at the end is to die for.

However, Track 16, listed as <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Aphrohead-AKA-Felix-Da-Housecat-In-The-Dark-We-Live-Thee-Lite/release/2133"><em>In The Dark We Live</em></a> by Aphrohead, always puzzled me. I was familiar with all of the vinyl releases of that cut and knew that on Vega's mix there was something else blended in that carried really distinctive vocals. <em>"I dance ... and I sweat ... and I let myself... Go!"</em> I searched high and low. I even got someone on Usenet to promise to unearth the secret. They never came through, go figure. I gave up the chase until I found Discogs.com

<a href="http://www.discogs.com/Head-Rush-Underground/release/181434"><img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Head Rush - Underground Cover.jpg" alt="Head Rush - Underground Cover.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="147" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" /></a> Digging around under Vega's discography I checked <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Little-Louie-Vega-United-DJs-Of-America-Vol-2-Little-Louie-Vega-New-York-City/release/22804">the DMC UK version of <em>United DJs V2</em></a>. Sure enough, "Notes:	 Sleeve mistakenly shows track 16 as Aphrohead - In The Dark We Live." Instead it was Head Rush's <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Head-Rush-Underground/release/181434"><em>Underground</em></a> and apparently the only track they ever released. Talk about obscure!

Technically the track listing is correct, but it would have also been fair to credit Head Rush in the liner notes as well. In a similar fashion, Vega cribs from himself and <em><a href="http://www.discogs.com/Kenny-Dope-Presents-Bucketheads-The-Bomb-These-Sounds-Fall-Into-My-Mind/release/39273">The Bomb (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)</a></em> makes an uncredited appearance early in the mix. Maybe it had something to do with licensing.
