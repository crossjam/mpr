As someone who has used Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and
aider, seems like a no-brainer to give opencode a test drive. The only
hesitation is [the terminal program requirements][3]:

> Alacritty, cross-platform

> Ghostty, Linux and macOS

> API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

I’m quite happy with iTerm2. These are all advanced variations on a
terminal, typically with accelerator driven graphics and/or AI
integration. Sounds wonderful but a bit heavyweight for me. Hopefully
the "like" is applicable to [iTerm2][4].
