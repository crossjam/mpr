My git-Fu is getting better, but I’m using it enough to start thinking about using a graphical client:
> [GitX-dev][1] is a fork (variant) of GitX, a long-defunct GUI for the git version-control system. It has been maintained and enhanced with productivity and friendliness oriented changes, with effort focused on making a first-class, maintainable tool for today's active developers.

Per usual anything that helps me deal with merges more efficiently and professionally gets my +1.
