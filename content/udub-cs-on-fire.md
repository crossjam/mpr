He called their Computer Science and Engineering up and coming. Took his advice and sent in an application. 

I got into 2 of the 3 places I applied, UDub and UC Berkeley, and visited both. I came away pretty impressed, especially because of some discussion time I had with [Tom Anderson][1], who was “just” a doctoral student at the time. He gave me some great advice on my decision and career, some of which I managed to follow.

Cal was my eventual choice, primarily on rep and the fact that I had a number of friends on campus and in the area, and I’ll never regret that decision. From afar though, I’ve admired the UW CSE program as it’s closed on the MIT/Berkeley/CMU/Stanford summit. 

I haven’t kept up with graduate rankings since I exited my former life, but [Jeff Heer and Daniela Rosner joining the UW faculty][2], not to mention [attracting Carlos Guestrin][3], indicates their further push to reach the top. A key has been building productive relationships with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and other locally based tech juggernauts. 

Occasionally *(but not often)* makes me wonder “what if?”
