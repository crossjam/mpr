Title: Making Progress
Status: published

Slowly but surely making progress on getting the blog authoring home
lab set up. Lots of under the hood fiddling with personal machinery
across a bunch of machines. Learned a lot of
[Ansible][1], [NFS][3], and [Samba][2]. The goal was to get an
environment where one machine can be mostly headless and build the
pages automatically. At the same time, the base blog content could be
remotely accessible via a home wifi LAN. A LAN that conveniently
reaches my back porch so I can author while sitting outside, a glass
of bourbon nearby.

The old scheme with WordPress and a desktop tool definitely had a
lighter path to posting. With some work, though, I’ll be able to
smooth out the process and get a bunch of upsides from the [Pelican][4]
ecosystem.
