[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/tarbell substrate.jpg" alt="tarbell substrate.jpg" border="0" width="225" height="75" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][4] For some reason, [Jared Tarbell's][2] [work][3] has stuck with me even thought I've never done any Flash programming or generative art. At [Complexification](http://www.complexification.net), he has [a beautiful  collection][4] of [processing](http://processing.org) sketches. Even though they're for an older version of processing, converting them to [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net)

Looking at [Tarbell's open source Flash works][1] some of those might also translate nicely as well.
