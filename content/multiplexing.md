Rafe Colburn is just now [getting into terminal multiplexing][1]. All I can add is that I’ve been using [GNU `screen`][2] for a few years and it’s really been a boon to my development. 

Usefully though, Colburn has a link detailing why [`tmux` might be better than `screen`][4]. The arguments are compelling. I might have to give [the competition][3] a test drive.
