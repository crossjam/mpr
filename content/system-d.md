Link parkin': Charlie Stross [comments on System D][1]:
> *System D is the planetary unregulated black market, concentrated in the developing world. Excluding traditional criminal activities (robbery, illegal narcotics, extortion) but including small-scale entrepreneurial activities that don't bother with red tape or taxes or safety regulations, it employs up to 50% of the planet's work force (1.8 billion workers) and is estimated to be worth **$10 trillion a year**.*

Over and above an apparently important emerging trend, the term System D just has a cool origin *(check the link)*.

Also, another shootout to a blogger (and author) who's work I really enjoy.
