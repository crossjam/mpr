Recently I started munging some really [large datasets][4] for work and for fun. In just doing some basic statistical verification I learned a [lesson][1] that Brendan O'Conor documented: [gawk][2] is really useful, reasonably fast, and some versions blaze.

I've got to go and check out [mawk][3], even if it is old and slightly busted.
