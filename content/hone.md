I’m not huge on [affirmations][1]. Lean more towards [stoicism][3]
than positivity spiritually manifesting success. On a daily basis,
though, I try to mentally hold on to a few concise phrases for
motivation and emotional guardrails. Shorter is better, and singular
words are often best.

Today, I became enamored of the verb [_hone_][2], defined in
Wiktionary as: 

> **Verb**
>
> **hone** (third-person singular simple present hones, present participle honing, simple past and past participle honed) 
>
> 1. (transitive) To sharpen with a hone; to whet.
> 2. (transitive) To use a hone to produce a precision bore.
> 3. (transitive) To refine (a skill especially) by learning. 
> 4. To make more acute, intense, or effective.

The last two meanings resonate. Moment to moment, I’m working to
refine myself into a more acute, intense, and effective
instrument. Added to the kit.
