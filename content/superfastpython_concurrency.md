Jason Brownlee seems super excited [about Python concurrency mechanisms][2]
(threads/processes) and helping developers better understand them. A
cursory scan of a few of his [tutorials][3] indicates a high level of
quality and coverage.

I’ve been doing a bit of Python thread programming in the day job, so
these topics are of interest.
