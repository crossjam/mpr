But I felt like I couldn't have just one book on the Kindle for iPod. It might get lonely. At least Amazon finally got the Tor.com titles up on the Kindle store. *Apologies in advance if the titles were hidden on a shelf and obscured from my view.*

In any event, taking advantage of [the Tor.com special][2] I purchased the following short stories:

1. *After the Coup* by John Scalzi (iBooks)

2. *Down on the Farm* by Charles Stross (iBooks)

3. *Shade* by Steven Gould (Kindle)

4. *The Girl Who Sang Rose Madder* by Elizabeth Bear (iBooks)

5. *Jack and the Aktuals, Or, Physical Applications of Transfinite Set Theory* by Rudy Rucker (iBooks)

6. *Errata* by Jeff VanderMeer (Kindle)

On a whim, I started with VanderMeer's *Errata*. I don't know if it's SF, but it's pretty damn weird. But oddly engaging. And the Kindle iPod reading experience has been pretty good so far.
