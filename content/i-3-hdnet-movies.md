First it was just the delight of seeing Salma Hayek in [*After the Sunset*][1]. Then it was being [reintroduced][7] to [*The Rundown*][2].

Did I mention the movies are uninterrupted (c.f. [the suckage of IFC][6])? Unmodified? Except for the occasional, tastefully displayed *HDNet Movies* logo. Letterboxed, to boot, so no pan and scan.

But the closer is that somebody in the programming department thought today would be a great day for a Quentin Tarantino double bill: [*Pulp Fiction*][3] and [*True Romance*][4]. Yeah, I know Tony Scott directed *True Romance*, but Tarantino wrote the script and Scott retained most of Tarantino's crime, violence, and dialogue oeuvre. It's essentially a Tarantino film.

**Brilliant**. Two of my favorite films of all time, and *Pulp Fiction* is in my top 3.

Set DVRs to stun.
