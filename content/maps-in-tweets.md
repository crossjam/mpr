MapBox has a new feature that let’s you [embed a map in a tweet][1]. I just think this is dang cool! But as a studied Twitter observer, I’m also interested in the various media types that can be distributed through Twitter. Seems like there’s a research project or two in there.

> MapBox maps are now fully integrated with Twitter. When you tweet a link to any map hosted on MapBox, it will show up inline on Twitter.com and in Twitter’s mobile apps. Your custom styles and markers will all show up as inline images with the title and description of your map. And when you click on them, they’ll take you to the full interactive map on MapBox.com.
