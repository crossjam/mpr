Consider the season broken. [Oregon 42, Cal 3.][1] And in such embarrassing fashion to boot!

Even if they somehow beat the Trojans next week, they'll still need the Ducks to stumble twice. Plus hope no one else goes undefeated in the Pac-10, fairly likely. And the Bears have to not trip up again themselves, a tall order.

Still have [The Big Game][3] to look forward too though.
