A while ago I finished [Nate Silver’s new book *(Amazon Affiliate link warning)*][2] currently enjoying a bit of attention at the end of this year’s political season. I enjoyed it, although I got a little too much poker, but haven’t had the time or urgency to put together a respectable write up. Thankfully, the estimable Stephen Few has done my work for me.
