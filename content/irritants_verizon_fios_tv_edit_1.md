Coming to Verizon FiOS TV from DirecTV over a year ago, [one of the major irritants][2] was the channel guide. You'd think it wouldn't be a big thing, but it seriously has me considering switching back to DirecTV, among a bunch of other things.

When we switched over, the main problem was the number of button presses it took to get the full episode information. Maybe there's a smarter way, but it always takes me three.

Recently, things seem to have gotten worse. First, the episode info, especially for premium channels, often doesn't have **any** actor information. Second, the category errors are increasing. Take for example, [*The Center of the World*][1] starring Molly Parker and Peter Sarsgaard. It's a film about a depressed guy, holing up in Vegas, who pays a hooker to hang out with him for three nights. Strong adult themes are the order of the day. Verizon happily categorized it as *Children*. That's it.

Sigh.

Then again this is an extreme First World problem to have.
