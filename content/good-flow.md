For whatever reason, the quality of items in my various knowledge serendipity flows (a.k.a. webfeeds, although not exclusively RSS) has had a burst of high quality recently. Obviously I want to save some items for further blogging, but a number of them are looking like this quality post on [*“A Year with MongoDB”*][1] found via [Hacker News][2]. Obviously this is one anecdotal experience, but it somewhat confirms my experience with MongoDB. Interesting to start, painful in practice.

On a side note, I’m looking at some of the data storage numbers the HNers are mentioning in the comments and feeling a sense of pride that a project at work has a dataset easily comparable.

Yeehah! I get to hang out with the cool kids.
