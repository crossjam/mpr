Despite my [extolling][2] the endurance of my late 2008 White MacBook, it looks like Apple is going to deny it an update for the next version of OS X. Dubbed Mountain Lion, Ars Technica is reporting [the list of supported machines][1]. And my Trusty Old MacBook doesn't make the cut.

C'est la vie. Hopefully they'll provide a few updates for Lion and I can keep productively using the old laptop. At least until I get my hands on my dream 15 inch Air-like PowerBook.
