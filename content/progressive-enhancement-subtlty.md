[Previously][1] I had posted on how [Bagcheck uses the CLI][2] to practice progressive enhancement. In my post I implied that the CLI was used to build a system’s API. That was incorrect.

The CLI is not part of the API. The CLI is the first, minimalist interface. It does help with automation, testing, designing the API, and prototyping. But it’s still just one interface step on the path to the whizzy web UI. 

A subtle but important point.
