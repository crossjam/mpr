Title: Joined Changelog++

Previously I mentioned [The Changelog][1] as one of [my current
favorite podcasts]({filename}favorite_pods_2022.md). [Run by Jerod
Santo and Adam Stacoviak][3], I use the term "podcast" loosely here,
because they have a small empire of [affiliated podcasts][4], [an
online community][6], and a [couple][7] of [newsletters][8]. There’s a
wide variety of great, well produced content in differing formats. And
they’ve been at it for [over 10 years][5] 😮!!

Anyway, I woke up one morning, was listening to an episode and heard
the plug for [Changelog++][2]. Figured it was high time I supported
these guys directly and pulled the trigger. Jerod promptly sent a nice
email the same day asking, "What was the driving factor(s) for you
signing up?" Here’s how I responded:

> Nothing specific. Been a subscriber to The Changelog for 6 years,
> Practical AI since it started, and now dipping into GoTime. I've
> just been on a little kick directly supporting small individual
> content creators where possible. The folks who make podcasting
> enjoyable for me on a regular basis. Love what you guys are doing
> and especially the Changelog "house" interview style. Great
> production values without sounding overly corporate.

Need to give a few ++ episodes a listen before I can provide any
concrete criticism, but so far, so good.
