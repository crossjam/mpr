I’m slowly following in [Ben Lorica’s big data footsteps][1]. On his recommendation I’ve decided to jump into Scala, starting with Odersky et. al.’s [*Programming in Scala*][2]. Like what I’m seeing so far. Functional programming, with a somewhat Pythonic sensibility, and performant exploitation of the JVM.
