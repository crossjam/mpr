[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Google Chrome Logo.png" alt="Google Chrome Logo.png" border="0" width="100" height="95" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Just went and pulled the trigger yesterday. On my Macbook, I flipped my default web browser to [Google's Chrome][1].

I had been using Apple's [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/). The main reason that Safari won out over Firefox at the time was that [Safari actually supports Apple scripting][2] *(of course)*. I don't really take advantage of that any more though.

Even with Flash turned on, Chrome just feels faster and cleaner. Nothing real definitive or quantitative that I can point to though. Basically a pure gut feeling. Your Mileage May Vary.
