[TheMacBundles][1] is doing something interesting. They'll let you build your own package of software.

For about $30 you can get your choice of 5 apps from a menu of about 20 plus. If you buy 10 or more, at about $5 per app, you get a little bit of a discount. So ala carte' is only slightly more expensive than the fixed bundle.

The problem for me is that I think I've hit my working set of small utilities and productivity tools, the bread and butter apps of bundles. The odds of any of these small apps making a qualitative difference in my Mac experience is slim relative to the cost. If I'm only going to get one hit per bundle, I might as well just purchase directly from a developer and not split the proceeds.

The [One Finger Discount][2] campaign had it right. Offer a significant discount along with a lot of choice, and I'll buy multiple tempting apps of my own volition.
