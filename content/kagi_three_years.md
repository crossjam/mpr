[Kagi][1], the alternative search engine and browser developer,
[turned three][2] this week.

I signed up for [Kagi Ultimate][3] in October of last year after
giving the free version a bit of a test drive and liking the results
Or more accurately the distinctly customer centered UX vice Google
Search. Can’t remember when it happened, but I also switched over to
the [Orion][4] browser shortly thereafter, mainly to maximize Kagi
Search usage but also for no-nonsense ad blocking. It’s also sort of
neat that they have a [search API][6].

Unlike many other subscriptions, when the bill for Kagi arrives I have
give canceling no consideration. YMMV but I can recommend
Kagi. Fingers crossed no rug pulls, third act betrayal reveals, and
many more years of success.

Heck, if [John Gruber][5] is a [paying customer][7] that’s saying
something.
