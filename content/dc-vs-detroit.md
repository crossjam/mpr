The Detroit Pistons against the hometown Washington Wizards. Both teams have lost at least 2 out of every 3 games this season. The Wizards have the second worst record in the league. The Pistons are in a bad bunch with the New Jersey Nets, the Toronto Raptors, and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

I know why the Wizards are awful. What I don't understand is how the Pistons can be so bad. When you look at their [roster][1], they've got two guys with championship rings in Tayshaun Prince and Ben Wallace. Ben Gordon is a proven scorer and has playoff experience. So there's veteran experience. Greg Monroe and Brandon Knight look like promising young players. Will Bynum, Jason Maxiell, Rodney Stuckey, and Charlie Villanueva have proven NBA talent. 

It's a shame a once proud franchise has fallen so far with no relief in site.

As for the Wizards, with Andray Blatche on the sideline for “conditioning”, that's 4 out of 5 that need to be gone. Although the way Jordan Crawford's shot selection is going, he might make the list soon. Dude ease up on the pound the dribble for 10 seconds then shoot possessions. The Wizards show flashes of quality but not well strung together and the team really doesn't know how to finish. But it beats the crap they had on the floor before.
