Amazingly the Sox did it with pitching and defense, not their hallmarks this season.

I was living in Chicago in 2003 and 2005. It's a great city in general, but a real blast when there are baseball playoffs in town. Every corner bar, and there are still quite a few, is a great place to catch a game. I can't imagine what the place will be like if both teams go deep in the playoffs.

Dreams of an eLevated series with the Cubs are still alive.
