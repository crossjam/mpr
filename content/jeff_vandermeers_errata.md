Like many other readers, who probably came expecting a work of standard speculative fiction, I was mostly confused by the surreal nature of the tale, although I enjoyed it.

I think. Maybe. Sort of.

The whole story is freely available on [tor.com](http://www.tor.com), but I got the 99 cent e-book version through Amazon's Kindle store. I did the reading on my iPod Touch which was fairly pleasant. It got even better once I figured out I could decrease the font size so I didn't have to flip pages as much. Suggestion to other newcomers to [Kindle for the iPhone][2], press those little A's in the interface, and experiment a bit. Might improve your reading experience.

At least I chuckled at mentions of Juliette the Penguin.
