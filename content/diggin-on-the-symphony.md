Shuffle landed me on Marly Marl’s [*“The Symphony, Part 1”*][5]. The beat is legendary but jeez, Big Daddy Kane brings it as the last Cold Chillin’ rapper with arguably [one of the greatest raps][1] of all time.
> <pre>… And battlin’ me is hazardous to your health
So put a quarter in your ass, cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin’ the path that Allah made
I’ll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin’ bigger
Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga! ...</pre>

And words on the screen can’t even begin to do justice to Kane’s enunciation and delivery.  Classic.

*Ob moment of silence for MCA (Adam Yauch). After odes to [Heavy D][3], [Guru][2], and [Malcolm Maclaren][4], I’m giving up obits in this space though.*
