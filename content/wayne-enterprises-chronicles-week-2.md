My 43 point margin victory is the highest in the league this year.

I take back any rude thoughts or comments I might have had about Arian Foster *(23 points)*, Hakeem Nicks *(30 points)*, and Cam Newton *(25 points)*. Tony Gonzalez and the Ravens DEF chipped in with double digits as well.

Marques Colston and Darren McFadden? Not so much. Run-DMC is troubling because he’s manifesting his usual inconsistency, but he’s my number two running back. At least he’s not injured … yet. I may have to work up a trade or an inspired waiver wire pick. Colston probably won’t even be on my week three roster. I know he’s in a high powered offense, but he’s not delivering at the moment.

Last week every team plays before the bye weeks kick in. Then things get really fun. I feel good about my team, but I need to shore up second positions at RB and WR.
