I'm sort of binary on Woody Allen films. If he's in the film, I can't stand it. If he's not I generally enjoy the flick: *Match Point*, *Cassandra's Dream*, *Vicky Cristina Barcelona*, *Celebrity*. The only exception has been *Manhattan*, but then that's a very exceptional film. His typical nebbish take drives me batshit.

I made the mistake of watching [*Anything Else*][2], even though I knew Allen had a role, principally because I like looking at Christina Ricci. It was doubly horrible because Jason Biggs filled the Allen lead role to accurate effect, meaning you had twice the nebbishness. Yeesh!

Glad someone else is in violent agreement, calling it [Woody Allen's worst film][1]. Oddly enough, Tarantino apparently loved *Anything Else*. No accounting for taste.
