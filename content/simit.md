[**Simit**][1], *A language for computing on sparse systems.*

> Simit is a new programming language that makes it easy to compute on sparse systems using linear algebra. Simit programs are typically shorter than Matlab programs yet are competitive with hand-optimized code and also run on GPUs.

> With Simit you build a graph that describes your sparse system (e.g. a spring system, a mesh or the world wide web). You then compute on the system in two ways: locally or globally. Local computations apply update functions to each vertex or edge of the graph that update local state based on the vertex or the edge and its endpoints. This part of the language is similar to what you find in graph processing framework such as GraphLab and its descendants.
