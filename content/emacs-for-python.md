[Purports to have an in-development mode for `virtualenvs`][2], which the world really needs and deserves:

> I’m collecting and customizing the perfect environment for python developement, using the most beautiful emacs customization to obtain a really modern and exciting (yet stable) way to edit text files.

> In the package are included also a lot of other packages and configurations, it’s an upstart for clean emacs installations, these configuration however are very similar to emacs-starter-kit and I suggest you to give it a try, emacs-for-python is designed to work with it (instruction below).
