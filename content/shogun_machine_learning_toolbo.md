Link parkin': [Shogun][1] is an open source machine learning C++ toolkit with wrappers for Octave, Matlab, R, and Python. Shogun focuses on SVM ([Support Vector Machine][2]) kernels. At least the web site has nice spit and polish, hopefully reflecting well on the library.

Now if I only understood the theory behind SVMS, at all.
