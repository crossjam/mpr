> CloudPull seamlessly backs up your Google account to your Mac. It supports Gmail, Google Contacts, Google Calendar, Google Drive (formerly Docs), and **Google Reader**. By default, the app backs up your accounts every hour and maintains old point-in-time snapshots of your accounts for 90 days.

Emphasis mine. Gonna’ try this out over the weekend.
