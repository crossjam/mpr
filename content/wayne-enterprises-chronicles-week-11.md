That’s the situation I found myself in and I did it basically with a QB, a WR, and a kicker.

* QB: Robert Griffin III, 39.7 points
* WR: Randall Cobb, 19.8 points
* K: Shayne Graham, 14 points

No one else scored in double figures, including fantasy #1 Arian Foster, and his team scored 43 points! Not to mention some unfortunate early morning lineup changes. First, playing Denarius Moore instead of Eric Decker or Miles Austin. The latter two only score 8 points but that was 8more than Moore. Second, pulling the Patriots DST for the Rams. -20 on the GM.

New rule. Never play Raiders.

Have to admit I was feeling a little nervous in the fourth quarter of the 4 PM matchups. I was only ahead by about 4 points, and my opponent still had Willis McGahee in his lineup in a close game. Little did I know that McGahee was out with a knee injury or that Stevan Ridley would seal the deal with a cheap garbage time touchdown.
