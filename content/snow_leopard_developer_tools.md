**BUT**, I had the developer's tools installed under Leopard.

After I upgraded to Snow Leopard, I didn't have the developer's tools installed. I'd pretty much say that's avoidable major breakage. One minute you can easily install source code packages from the 'Net, the next you can't. And this one seems easily avoidable, although I'm not an Apple engineer so there's probably a good reason for not doing the detection and the tool install automatically.

I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'.
