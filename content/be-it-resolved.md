I'm generally not big on announcing resolutions, although I have done so in the past. Let's give it a shot for 2012.

* **Improve Physical Health**. The holidays definitely have me backsliding but at least I've got the basics of exercise and weight loss going. Main goals are to lose about 20 pounds and play some pickup ultimate without embarrassing myself. No injuries. Stretch goal is to play organized ultimate like a league or hat tournament. Also, improve the nutritional intake. More veggies.

* **Maintain Financial Health**. A little over 3 years ago, I was barely above water on a condo I wasn't living in. I also had a pretty big pile of personal debt. That dispiriting conversation with a parent about a loan was looming. Luckily I closed on a sale just before John McCain announced he was suspending his campaign and wrecked the economy. Fiscal management took over at my household and now I'm in pretty good shape. No going back in 2012. Avoid lifestyle creep. Pay everything on time, no fees or penalties. 10% more of take home pay stashed into retirement instruments. Double my charitable contributions.

* **Shine The Skillz**. The Mad Data Scientist exercises at home and work have exercised old programming muscles. In 2012, I'm going to work hard on regular hacking activity and getting some more professional interaction and training. I'm looking to attend three programmer events where I get in a workshop, class, or coding sprint.

* **Expand The Network**. Once a month either get back in touch with an old professional contact or make a new one. Special focus on people local to the DC area. Join the MIT and UC Berkeley alumni clubs of DC and attend 6 events total. Update resume. Flesh out LinkedIn profile.

* **Get Rid of Stuff**. I've got stuff in a storage site that I haven't visited in over 3 years. It can't be that important so time to go. Also, the wardrobe needs a major flush. Clearing half of that space is the target.

* **Build A Tribe**. Over the last few years I've been leaning back and trying to be good teammate. This past year I'm starting to see technical challenges and opportunities that really excite me. But they all involve pulling people together to build something bigger than any one individual. This actually goes against my general nature but it's the next meaningful life step. A high functioning team of three to five people would be an achievement.

* **Less Watch, More Do**. Cut down on the number of weekend days I completely lose laying on the couch watching sports. More days with more hacking. More time spent doing real activities with My Little Guy (TM).

And of course keep on posting!!
