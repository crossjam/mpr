Over the weekend I finished John Scalzi’s [*The Human Division*][1] in its serial form. In general I enjoyed it, although [my complaints][2] about it being quite talky still hold. Actually my biggest complaint is that Amazon couldn’t collapse my one click purchases, so my credit card statement is littered with a lot of noise. There were also quite a few loose threads.

If there’s one standout episode for me, it was [*This Must Be The Place*][3]. For some reason I really empathized with Hart Schmidt even though my family situation in no way resembled his. Maybe I’m misremembering the prior three *Old Man’s War* books, but there seems to be a much higher level of character development.
