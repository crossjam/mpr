The $20 price, driven by some of Twitter’s token limiting practices. induced some sticker shock. However, I didn’t think long before pulling the trigger. 

Lex Friedman has [a pretty good review of Tweetbot][1] explaining why it’s worth the price:

> Of course, this is a review of the excellent new Tweetbot for Mac (Mac App Store link), not a review of Twitter’s business practices. But I bring up the latter here because one of the effects of Twitter’s new developer restrictions—specifically, the finite limit on how many users a given Twitter client can support—is that developer Tapbots is charging more for the new app than originally planned. Specifically, Tweetbot for Mac will cost you $20, at a time when many similar apps can be found for $10 or less. Which means that for many readers, the question isn't just whether Tweetbot is good, but whether it's worth the price.

> **My answer: Yes.**

Like Friedman, I’ve sprung for Tweetbot on MacOS, iPad, and iPhone.
