TIL: [Podcast Index][1]

> The Podcast Index is here to preserve, protect and extend the open,
> independent podcasting ecosystem.

> We do this by enabling developers to have access to an open,
> categorized index that will always be available for free, for any
> use. 

Has an [API][3]. Interestingly, [the entire podcast database][2]
_(guessing not full content of enclosures isn’t included)_ can be
downloaded. Mmmmmm... data.

The team behind the Podcast Index is leading [a Podcasting 2.0
"movement"][4] to add some features to RSS to improve the podcast
experience for publishers and listeners.

> Podcasting 2.0 is a set of forward looking ideas combined with the
> technology to realize them. It's a vision for what the podcast
> listener experience can and should be. That experience has stagnated
> for over a decade, with almost all of the improvements coming in
> isolated sections of the ecosystem. There hasn't been a single,
> unified vision from the podcasting community acting together with
> one voice. So, we've ended up with fragments of innovation across
> the podcasting landscape with no central driving goal in
> mind. Podcasting 2.0 is the expression of what that goal could be.

Bonus project: [Sucky][5] pulls down an RSS feed and all of its
enclosures.

_Hat tip to a great [Changelog podcast episode][7], natch, discussing
RSS with Ben Ubois, the creator of one of my favorite services
[feedbin][6]._
