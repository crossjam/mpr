As a card carrying member of late 80's, early 90's hip-hop fandom, I'm sort of torn by Kia's latest [hamster commercial][1]. On the one hand, it's a pretty well done homage to Black Sheep's [*The Choice is Yours*][2].

On the other hand, it's freekin' **hamsters**.

And of course [the original video][3] is still a classic. I'm surprised Kia didn't make more of a connection, especially with Dres and Mr. Lawnge reaching into and crumpling up the screen.
