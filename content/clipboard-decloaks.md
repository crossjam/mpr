If it wasn’t for the fact that [Gary Flake][2] is leading the team, I’d think [Clipboard](https://clipboard.com/) was a derivative, me-too product. His [*Going Public*][1] post makes it seem really interesting though. I’ll have to check it out, especially if they make an API available *(mentioned by not discussed by Flake)*.
