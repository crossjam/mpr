I didn't use GDesktop a lot, but I have (had) [a handy LaunchBar plug-in][3] that made it easy to use. [Google Quick Search Box][2] is intended as the replacement. As of this writing, QSB's interface is confusing the heck out of me. Apparently QSB is not much more than an application launcher wrappred around Spotlight and souped up with access to information in your Google account(s).

I'll give QSB a cursory trial but I'll probably wind up sticking with LaunchBar and Spotlight.

Apropos of nothing, I'd also like to take this opportunity to curse the [MacPorts migration process][5] for mucking up my [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) installation. I use ImageMagick to process the images for this site from the command line. The tools were well integrated into my workflow. Yet another strike against MacPorts.

Hoping to be completely unbusted on Snow Leopard by the end of the week.
