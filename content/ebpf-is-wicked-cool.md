Quentin Monnet is making it easy to [dive into eBPF][1].

> So instead, here is what we will do. After all, I spent some time reading and learning about BPF, and while doing so, I gathered a fair amount of material about BPF: introductions, documentation, but also tutorials or examples. There is a lot to read, but in order to read it, one has to find it first. Therefore, as an attempt to help people who wish to learn and use BPF, the present article introduces a list of resources. These are various kinds of readings, that hopefully will help you dive into the mechanics of this kernel bytecode.

A little virtual machine running inside the kernel is such a wicked concept.
