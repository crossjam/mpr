Turns out it was  less painful than I thought it would be, although it took a few tries. That's what occupied my March and early April. 

Also decided my tenure at [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/) was getting a little stale. Thanks to the recommendations on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) I'm giving [Linode](http://linode.com/) a twirl.

There's still some nits and splinters I have to be careful of, but I'm feeling confident enough to pull the switch. So there probably will be some breakage around here. People subscribed in a feed reader may suffer the most. 

You have been warned.
