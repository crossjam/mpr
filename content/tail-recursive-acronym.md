I don’t know if the games are any good, but I’ll give Michael Cook a +1 for a [moby hack][2]. [Growing games][3] is sort of cool.

But **+11** for a [tail-recursive][1] acronym:
> On Friday, however, Cook released a game called A Puzzling Present which shows off the much of the hard work Cook's put into Angelina (a tail-recursive acronym for "A Novel Game-Evolving Labrat I've Named ANGELINA"). Instead of a simple platformer with maps and obstacles, the latest games by Angelina now include new mechanics for the player (in this particular seasonal game, the character is Santa Claus) at each level.
