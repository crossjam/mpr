[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/We Feel Fine Cover.jpg" alt="We Feel Fine Cover.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="150" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][7] Chris Heathcote [observes][1] that [last.fm](http://last.fm) was looking to hire a "data griot", although I think the position listing has been removed. I'm guessing the job involves data analysis, visualization, and storytelling about the results. I'd sign up for that gig!

The terms [*data science*][3] and [*data scientist*][2] seem like they might be heading for fad territory, but the demand for [a particular combination of hard skills][4] is definitely on the way up. I'm not sure how merging those talents with the artistic stylings of a real [griot][5] is advantageous in a commercial context, but with an explosion of massive data, I can see an expansion in creative opportunities.

In short, there's a lot more room for guys like [Jonathan Harris][6].
