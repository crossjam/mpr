Greg Linden and I go way back, although very superficially. He linked to a post on my old blog. I was a user of Findory. We may have exchanged a few emails. I still subscribe to his blog’s feed.

Even so, I get a kick out of “knowing” someone who’s had a big impact on the computing industry, as evidenced by Greg, along with collaborators Brent Smith and Jeremy York, receiving [a Test of Time award][1] for their research article on Amazon’s early item-based recommendation system.

> On its 20th anniversary, the editorial board created its first ever “The Test of Time” award. I'm honored to say they gave it to our 2003 article, ["Amazon.com Recommendations: Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering"][2], which continues to be accessed, cited, and used in industry and research many years after its original publication. 

[Their follow-up article][3] is also quite enjoyable. It provides practical insights into actually deploying such a recommendation algorithm, especially as experience has been gained over time. Congratulations!
