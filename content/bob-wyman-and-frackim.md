A long time ago there was an interesting little startup named [PubSub][2] that provided [prospective search][3]. Back in [my past life](http://crossjam.net/wp/nmh/), I definitely [had a thing for PubSub][4]. And I especially enjoyed [Bob Wyman's blogging][5] before he finally tailed off after PubSub crashed.

I had heard that he'd migrated to Google, but wasn't really sure what he was up to. Can't say as I do know now, but [Wyman popped up recently][1] in my feeds, experimenting of course with prospective search. Apparently Google's AppEngine now supports a [*Prospective Search Service*][6]. Wyman has glued in some external real-time streaming services as sources, the Prospective Search Service for matching/filtering (which he knows a lot about), and instant messaging through XMPP to deliver matches to clients. The result is [FrackIM][7].

Neat! And the possibility of [following Wyman][8] might be enough to get me to actually use Google+.

A lot has changed technically on the Web since PubSub went off the air. Wonder if they were just ahead of their time, which means the core ideas could make a comeback. Then again, there never turned out be much of a business model for these services.
