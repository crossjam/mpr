Good personal development bit by Marc Hedlund on [leaving behind career tools][1] that have been overtaken by events:
> Advancement is not a collection of skills. Advancement is an awesome ability to adapt to a new situation. Experience is a toolbox to help you do that – but any new job, any new role, any environmental change should make you question whether the tool you know and rely on is still the right tool for the job. Think of your skills as disposable, and actively work on unlearning the ones that were right once but aren’t right now.

This also seems like a good feature, maybe even interview question, to seek in candidates to join your team. *“Talk about a skill you really relied on in one position but had to give up or adapt as you moved into a new position. Why?”*
