For whatever the reason, today was chock full of link fodder. Some of it I’ll be saving for later in the week, but [Hilary Mason’s announcement][1] of [new, real-time, streaming APIs][2] tickles my fancy.

> We just released a bunch of social data analysis APIs over at bitly. I’m really excited about this, as it’s offering developers the power to use social data in a way that hasn’t been available before. There are three types of endpoints and each one is awesome for a different reason.

Already scheming some data collection and analysis projects.
