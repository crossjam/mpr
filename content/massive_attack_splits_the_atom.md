I've really enjoyed [Massive Attack][1] over the years. They've recently released a new album, [*Helgioland*][2]. [Via io9][4] I ran across [the video for *Splitting the Atom*][3]. Not quite sure it lives up to io9's hype, but it's an interesting exercise.

Apropos of Massive Attack, I have to strongly dissent with [Sashe Frere Jones' opinion][5] of Massive Attack's [*Mezzanine*][6]. Although he does say *Mezzanine* is "equally strong" compared to *Blue Lines*, the rest of the article feels like a subtle dis. *Mezzanine*'s grungy, darker, downer tempos are the pinnacle of their work. I like a lot of the earlier more danceable stuff, especially *Unfinished Sympathy*, but *Angel* and *Group Four* make the top of the Massive Attack list for me.

Between Massive Attack and [a reemergent Sade][7], might be time to visit some old friends through an MP3 store.
