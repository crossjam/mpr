Steve Holden, who know’s a bit or two about Python, gives his [explanation of the existence of the tuple datatype][1] in the programming language:
> And that, best beloved, is what tuples are for: they are ordered collections of objects, and each of the objects has, according to its position, a specific meaning (sometimes referred to as its semantics). If no behaviors are required then a tuple is "about the simplest thing that could work."

Has some good insights, but I think tuple immutability and hashability is vastly undersold.
