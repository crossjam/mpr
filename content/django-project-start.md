Okay, I learned a lot from this post, [*Starting a Django Project the Right Way*][1]:
> One of the things I wish I had known when starting my Django project for IllestRhyme was "How do I start a real Django project". As in, one that's actually going to be used and developed more, not the toy project from the (admittedly execellent) Django documentation.

> Having just gone through this process again for my new site, I wanted to share the knowledge I've gained about how to properly start a project in Django.

In addition, the comments are well worth reading.
