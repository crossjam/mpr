I needed to use it before January 31st so started casting about for things of interest.

DJ mix house music is still a tough get. Not to mention that Amazon often sells dj mixes as one big mp3, not separating the tracks. However, the other two major services, iTunes Music Store and <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">eMusic</a>, have this bad habit as well, so I can't ding them too hard for this.

Going back to my hip-hop roots, I finally settled on <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Boogie+Down+Productions">Boogie Down Productions</a> <a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/176704"><em>Criminal Minded</em></a>. But heresy of heresy, you can't buy <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Public+Enemy">Public Enemy's</a> <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Public-Enemy-It-Takes-A-Nation-Of-Millions-To-Hold-Us-Back/release/86636"><em>It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em></a>. A quick peek in the iTMS reveals they have it "in stock".
