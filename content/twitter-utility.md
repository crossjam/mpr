I was connected to a few friends, but wasn't tweeting much useful or seeing many useful tweets.

Recently I added a few data science folks, and began slowly expanding my follows. Now I'm getting a lot of interesting links, even hitting [Tweetbot][1] multiple times in a day. Props to Ben Lorica, [@bigdata](http://twitter.com/#!/bigdata), Jimmy Lin, [@lintool](http://twitter.com#!/lintool) and Joe Hellerstein, [@joe_hellerstein](http://twitter.com/#!/joe_hellerstein) for bringing the good bits. Hilary Mason [@hmason](http://twitter.com/#!/hmason) and Andy Hickl [@andyhickl](http://twitter.com/#!/andyhickl) provide a little personality and I've got an emerging cluster of Python folks including David Beazley, [@dabeaz](http://twitter.com/#!/dabeaz), Wes McKinney, [@wesmckinn](http://twitter.com/#!/wesmckinn), and Adam Klein, [@atomklein](http://twitter.com/#!/atomklein).
