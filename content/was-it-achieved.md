Before I generate a set of resolutions for 2103, I thought it would be worthwhile to check in on the results of [last year’s goals][1]:

* **Improve Physical Health**. Wash. Lost some weight, pretty close to target, but didn’t really incorporate exercise. Improved the diet, but failed to play any ultimate.
* **Maintain Financial Health**. Achieved. Hit all targets.
* **Shine The Skillz**. Wash. Did not get into any real programmer events, but work offered a lot more hacking opportunity than I anticipated.
* **Expand The Network**. Fail. I joined the MIT DC Alumni Club, but haven’t had a chance to attend any events. Missed on everything else.
* **Get Rid of Stuff**. Complete Fail.
* **Build A Tribe**. I’ll call it a fail, although the jury’s still out, pending my performance reviews at work. Even without that feedback, I’m still disappointed I haven’t been able to energize a really high performing group of people, with a good sense of camaraderie.
* **Less Watch, More Do**. Achieved. Took a sabbatical from college football to good effect. Also severely cut down on the channel surfing.

A couple of wins, a couple of washes, and three fails, so an overall “enh” from me. These were intended to be stretch goals so I can’t complain too much. 

Given a few other things that happened in my life in 2012, I’ll happily bid goodbye to the annum, but hold back on the good riddance.
