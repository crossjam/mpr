No, I didn't have a drinking problem. Occasionally I challenge myself with habit building exercises. This started off as a half whim and then I just kept rolling with it. Sort of like [Jerry Seinfeld's streak lifehack](http://lifehacker.com/software/motivation/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626.php).

While surprisingly easy and pointless, it was also oddly satisfying. With the holidays and my wife's penchant for social activities, there were plenty of opportunities to end the little experiment. Somehow I managed to wriggle off the hook each time.

I'm probably going to bust the streak later this week, as I meet up with an old drinking buddy for the first time in over a decade. We'll probably tip back a beer or two.

Just wanted to log the achievement.
