I have some serious tab proliferation in both Chrome and Firefox. I’ll have to check out the [**Tree Style Tab**][2] Firefox plug-in.
> This provides tree-style tab bar, like a folder tree of Windows Explorer. New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.
