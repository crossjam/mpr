[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Solar Cover.jpg" alt="Solar Cover.jpg" border="0" width="128" height="119" align="right" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Now this is the kind of content I really enjoy from [io9](http://io9.com). A nice, in-depth [review][1], by [Charlie Jane Anders][4], of Ian McEwan's book [*Solar*][2]. *Solar*, a tale of a physics anti-hero that's part speculative fiction, part satire, and from a literary star seems right up my alley, cf. [Margaret Atwood][3].

The problem for me is that *Solar* is currently only available in hardback. I'm really avoiding those editions these days due to the bulk. *No, I don't have or lust for a Kindle or iPad*. I'll be waiting for a trade paperback version, which we might never get here in the US.

P. S. I wish Anders could spend more time on book reviews, as opposed to all the other electronic media related posts she generates. At least that ill-fated writing advice theme bit the dust. Too inside baseball.
