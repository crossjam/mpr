Here in the states we celebrate a Thursday holiday with food and
entertainment gluttony, followed by a Friday of manufactured physical
retail (traditionally) consumer gluttony, followed the next Monday
with manufactured online consumer gluttony.

And then we try to cleanse the palate with "Giving Tuesday".

I’ve pretty much trended to flipping the script on those days,
although I do love a bit of food gluttony. This year I achieved
nothing purchased on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, nor even over the
weekend which used to be my consumer gluttony escape hatch. On Giving
Tuesday I batched up a whole bunch of my annual giving which usually
gets done the last week of December.

Not going to go into all of my charitable contributions, but just
wanted to plug [supporting membership][1] in the [Python Software
Foundation][2]. I’ve gotten a ton out of Python over my career and I
really enjoy the programming language, so it’s only right I give back
a little. I have no idea what benefits accrue from supporting
membership but I’m doing my bit to publicize their availability and
encourage other Pythonistas to join up.
