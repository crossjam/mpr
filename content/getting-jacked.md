Mat Honan [got jacked][1]. Kiddies wrecked his online presence for the lulz, exposing some severe security deficiencies in Amazon and Apple security procedures. It’s a bit of a cause célèbre, invoking a lot of suggestions on how to safeguard one’s self. 

[Like Tim Bray][2], I heart 1Password but need to do more, especially since I’m a heavy Amazon user. Following Matt Cutts’ advice, I’ll be [turning on 2 Factor Authentication][3]. Wired also has [a number of solid suggestions][4], along with lots of other info kicking across the Web. Do yourself a favor and partake of the wisdom.

And I always thought that remote wipe capability was a bit of a hinky idea.
