I’ve been poking around for a while on the Interwebs looking for accessible streaming data sources besides the oversubscribed Twitter feeds. Today I stumbled across [Satori][2], with [an initial description of the service][1] from their blog:

> Why? Because the world of open data needs to change. Right now there is a trove of open, public data available all over the world. But instead of being able to realize its potential, that data is at-rest on a variety of disparate websites across the internet.

> By coalescing the world’s open data into streaming live data and making it available for free, we’ll be able to see new solutions to big problems and ideas that haven’t even been thought of yet.

> With Satori, any developer with a computer, anywhere in the world can create a free account and have unlimited access to live open data to build the live data apps.

Right now I’d be nervous building anything serious on such a new service, lest they run out of money and abruptly shut down the service. For throwaway noodling and proofs-of-concept it looks like Satori provides something valuable. If nothing else, a convenient [feed of Wikipedia edits][3] would be interesting to experiment with.
