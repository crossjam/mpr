According to MetaFilter, today is [*Neuromancer*'s birthday][1]. Still love this book and think it holds up well after 26 years.

I'm tempted to get [a new MetaFilter account][2] just to smack the MeFites who are calling *Neuromancer* irrelevant and overtaken by the passage of time. If you move past the computing tropes that Gibson created (jacking in, cyberspace, hacking runs) and focus on the hyper-globalization *(instantaneous travel anywhere on the globe and even off of it, swirling merge of ethnicities and cultures)*, the personification of massive wealth *(corporate and family)*, and media hacking as a weapon *(remember that "terrorist" attack on SenseNet?)* it's still pretty damn relevant.

Frankly, Gibson got a lot more of the shape of our current world right than wrong.

But here, [I am definitely a fanboy][3].
