The third Health Data Initiative Forum is holding [The Health Datapalooza][1] right here in Washington, D. C. June 5-6 2012, right downtown. I do some healthcare technology related thinking for work, so this seems like a no-brainer. Not sure I like the pure app contest + keynotes format, but I'll give it a shot.
