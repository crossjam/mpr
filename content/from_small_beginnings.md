[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Early Magnetosphere.jpg" alt="Early Magnetosphere.jpg" border="0" width="125" height="83" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Well my [100 hours project][4], now named peyote, has been dinking and dunking along. I need to total up the time, but I've put in a pretty decent amount of effort. The new year has brought a burst of energy.

I've also taken some inspiration from [Robert Hodgin's][2] work and [blog][5], especially [the Magnetosphere series][1], which apparently had quite humble beginnings itself. Hope he doesn't mind me making a thumbnail of one his pictures. His [portfolio site][1] is quite well done.

And today I achieved [the smallest of victories][3].

peyote is intended to be a mashup of the bit processing capabilities of [processing](http://processing.org) with some of the vector drawing capabilities of [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net), all in Python. Today I got enough of the pieces together to write a small peyote program that actually created a non-trivially interesting animation.

I've got a lot of plans for peyote. It'll be a slow grind, but I'm slightly pumped. No I don't have any videos. No I'm not up on [GitHub](http://github.com). No I'm not ready to release the code. More to come.
