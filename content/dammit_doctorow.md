So I just recently [mentioned][2] how I’m trying to fight off some media
[FOMO][3].

And then Cory Doctorow posts about all [the books he reviewed][1] in 2022.

I’m already in the hole four titles, one completed, in hand from this
list (_Chokepoint Capitalism_, _A Half-Built Garden_, _The
Persuaders_, and finished _Survival of the Richest_ ). Now I’m getting
excellent blurbs on further material for the library, from a favorite
blogger. Definitely eyeing a handful of the nonfiction recommendations
and it may be time for me to come back around to Neal Stephenson.

I’m going to swipe from another of my faves, Tim Bray, in a post
worthy of discussion here, and say [Protect Me From What I Want!!][4].
