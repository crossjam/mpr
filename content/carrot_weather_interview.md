[Daring Fireball][1]’s Jon Gruber conducted [an amusing interview][2] with Brian
Mueller, the developer behind [Carrot Weather][3]. 

Carrot tells me my first install was a little under 4 years ago, on
November 12th, 2021. Feels like it’s been much longer. I’ve probably
opened it over 95% of the days since then.

_Awaiting [the unofficial transcript][4] for some interesting pull
quotes._

The fact that the app has personality is one of its best features. I
first heard of [the Will Smith / Chris Rock contretemps][5] from Carrot.

It’s an extremely well designed, well featured, and non-intrusive
app. I highly recommend it to all meatbags.
