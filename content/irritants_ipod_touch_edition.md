Whenever you hold the device in a landscape position, you get CoverFlow. There's [no setting to disable][3] this.

You can't start a playlist by double tapping on the playlist name.

Guess what, you [can't shuffle by album][2], which you can do on an iPod Nano.

Still extremely chapped about [not scrolling long titles][1].

And I hate apps that pop out to Safari to display a URL. Problem is you can't easily pop back into the original app. Just embed WebKit, like NetNewsWire does.

This is mostly about the poor interface in iTunes music playback. I've noticed that you really don't have a cursor which may be part of the problem. The scrolling is BS though. ESPN has a horizontal crawl in its apps. Why can't Apple get this one little detail correct.

Also, you've got this big display area and metadata on each track, but all those beautiful pixels aren't being put to any use.
