From the [GitHub repo][1]
> Winton Kafka Streams is a Python implementation of Apache Kafka's Streams API. It builds on Confluent's librdkafka (a high performance C library implementing the Kafka protocol) and the Confluent Python Kafka library to achieve this.

> The power and simplicity of both Python and Kafka's Streams API combined opens the streaming model to many more people and applications.

Wasn’t really into using Java to tinker with [Kafka Streams][2], but now I’m intrigued. Wonder if the Python library is feature parallel?
