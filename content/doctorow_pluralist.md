Title: Doctorow’s Memex

I’ve occasionally dipped into [Cory Doctorow’s][2] publishing ouerve
but never drank from his internet posting firehose. Apparently [he
left Boing Boing][3] a bit ago and started his own link blogging site
[_Pluralistic_][1]. As you would expect of Doctorow, it’s a flood of
interesting content, leftish, activist, cryptopunk oriented, no
surveillance capitalism to be seen.

Part of his [_20 Years Blogging_][3] post is a detailed description of
an linkblogger’s daily creative processs. In no way could I ever
emulate that, but I was struck by a comment on his vast trove of
previously published content:

> My composition is greatly aided both 20 years' worth of mnemonic
> slurry of semi-remembered posts and the ability to search
> memex.craphound.com (the site where I've mirrored all my Boing Boing
> posts) easily.
>
> A huge, searchable database of decades of thoughts really simplifies
> the process of synthesis.

So for me throwing as much stuff as possible you’ve read, written, or
listened to, into a your personal memex and sprinkling in a bit of
search/AI technology seems like an interesting, if not winning,
proposition. If nothing else, repeated elements like _This Day in
History_ can be semi-automated.

And I think I’ll give _Pluralistic_ a try.
