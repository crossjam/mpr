[<img src="http://crossjam.net/mpr/media/Google Chrome Logo.png" alt="Google Chrome Logo.png" border="0" width="100" height="95" align="left" style="margin: 10px;" />][1] Thanks to [1Password working][2] in [Google Chrome][1], I'm starting to use Google's browser more and more often. Not quite ready to make the full time leap, but here are some reasons I might.

Overall performance is pretty good, but not lights out amazing. This might be my net connection, even though I've got fiber. Often when opening new URLs, the Chrome retrieval indicator will spin for a bit. But then pages render almost instantaneously.

I like Alt-Return to open tab in foreground, Option-Return to open tab in background.

The Chrome [address bar][3] is a decent equivalent of Firefox's Awesome Bar. Even better is the fact that Chrome combines search across your browsing history, Google search, and keywords. Turns out to be pretty convenient.
