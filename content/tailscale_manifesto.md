Title: The  TailScale Manifesto

I was browsing around [the TailScale blog][1] and bounced over to one
of their recommended posts, [_Remembering the LAN_][2] which is really
this [post][3]. I’m of an age similar to [David Crawshaw][4] and can
empathize with this sentiment:

> The LAN was a magical place to learn about computers. Besides the
> physical aspect of assembling and disassembling machines, I could
> safely do things unthinkable on the modern internet: permission-less
> file sharing, experimental servers with no security, shared software
> where any one machine could easily bring down the network by typing
> in an innocuous command. Even when I did bring down the network the
> impact never left the building. I knew who I had to apologise to. 

And his essay answered the question of TailScale’s campfire origin
story:

> We can have the LAN-like experience of the 90's back again, and we
> can add the best parts of the 21st century internet. A safe small
> space of people we trust, where we can program away from the prying
> eyes of the multi-billion-person internet. Where the outright
> villainous will be kept at bay by good identity services and good
> crypto. 

A LAN-like experience across the global Internet. A worthy goal
indeed.

_Also diggin’ ["Software I’m thankful for"][5]. Except for vim, said
the Emacs guy 🤣_
