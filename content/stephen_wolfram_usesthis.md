I know everyone else is pointing to [Stephen Wolfram's *the setup* entry][1], but it's sort of cool to see the tech one of the world's smartest people uses on a daily basis. The only surprising thing is the general "off-the-shelfness" of [Wolfram's][2] tools. Obviously [Mathematica][3] had to be #1 on the list, although I'm sure it's completely kitted out with extensions, tweaks, and alpha features. Other than that, nothing really surprising or extravagant.

Except maybe for the [telepresence robot][4].
