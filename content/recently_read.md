Just for my memory, here's what I've completed recently, with some brief commentary:

* [*Going Postal*][1], Terry Pratchett. Just randomly grabbed it off the rack, without knowing it was a Nebula Award nominee. Great choice, and exceedingly poignant given our recent global financial woes.

* [*The Jennifer Morgue*][2], Charles Stross. I probably gobbled this too fast and gave myself indigestion. The bonus short story and afterword tasted better.

* [*The Forever War*][3], Joe Haldeman. Back in print finally. Started out slowly but then exploded into classic status.

* [*The Black Swan*][4], Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I'm generally sympathetic to Taleb's philosophy about our inability to deal with randomness. But way too much diatribe larded on to make this an enjoyable read.

That makes 7 completed for the year, and the rate is picking up. It's going to be tough but I still might hit my [35 book target][5] for the year.
