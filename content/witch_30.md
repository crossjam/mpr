Missed the news that [Many Tricks][4] released a new version of [Witch][2]. Witch is an add-on/replacement keyboard driven window switcher for Mac OS X. Along with [Launchbar][3], Witch is ingrained as part of my Mac muscle memory.

Dan Moren at Macworld provides [a compact overview of Witch's new features][1], while [the Witch homepage][2] has more details. One nice thing is the ability to override the built-in Command-H tab switcher, which I still use way too frequently. I also learned a lot of command switching tips, which Witch now emulates as well.

Looks like I'll have to pay $8 for the upgrade, but I'm sure it'll be well worth the cost.
