I abdicated Twitter well over three years ago, but with the recent
events regarding the company changing ownership I decided to check in and
see how long I’d actually been on the service:

[According to Wikipedia][1], that "Joined February 2007" means my
account was established within the first year of the service and 7
months of its initial public launch 😮.

Abdicating was driven by pursuit of "deep work" and avoidance of the
cognitive and emotional drain the site represents. I know there are
some vibrant, useful, and potentially interesting to me community
pockets within Twitter. Good on them, but I haven’t missed it for a
moment. There is a somewhat juvenile impulse to jump back on for a one
tweet dunk on the order of "Look at me! I bailed before **all** the
shit **really** hit the fan. What are ya’ll still doing here?!" but I like to
think I’ve gotten more mature with age.

There was about 30 seconds where I thought it might be cool to join
[the fediverse][2] and see where this all might eventually land, but I
quickly came to my senses. If I didn’t need what was on offer before
why would I need it now?

This adventure was prompted by an article entitled ["What happens to
sports media if Twitter dies?"][3]. It will likely be my last
commentary about Twitter for quite some time.
