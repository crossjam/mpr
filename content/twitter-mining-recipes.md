Link parkin’: [Matt Russell’s repo][1] for his book “21 Recipes for Mining Twitter”

> *“This repository contains code for the 21 Recipes for Mining Twitter
(O'Reilly, 2011.) As the name of the title suggests, it's a short cookbook of
recipes that's designed to help you solve common problems when working with
Twitter data. Some of the recipes are extracted from content presented in
Mining the Social Web while others are completely new additions. In either
case, they're designed to be bite-sized and serve as the jetpack that you can
strap onto that great Twitter mining idea you've been noodling on -- whether
it's as simple as running some disposible scripts to crunch some numbers or
as extensive as creating full-blown interactive web application.”*
