*Merry Christmas and happy holidays folks!!*

Once you get a moderately complex `cron` entry and set of `bash` scripts working there's a nice sense of satisfaction. You gotta like collecting, archiving, ingesting, and indexing 100's of megabytes of data in your sleep. On a holiday. If it keeps happening night after night, so much the better.

I'm particularly patting myself on the back because it only took one debug cycle to get things working. Surprised myself there.
