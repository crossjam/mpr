[*The Art of Manliness* dug into][1] the book [*Great by Choice*][2], and pulled a common theme of successful organizations, “The 20 Mile March”:

> Collins and Morten dubbed the slow and steady approach taken by Southwest and other 10X companies “The 20 Mile March.” They took this moniker from imagining a man determined to walk across the United States, and how he could accomplish his goal faster by committing to walking 20 miles every single day  – rain or shine — rather than walking for 40-50 miles in good weather and then very few miles or not at all during inclement conditions.

My biggest achievements last year, collecting lots of Tweets and blogging continuously, inadvertently embraced The 20 Mile March ethos. I’ll be looking to build my 2013 resolutions with even more awareness of the components of this approach. Weight reduction/exercise and side-hacking are going to make repeat appearances this year. Let’s see if applying 20 Mile March techniques help increase my level of success.
