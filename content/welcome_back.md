Title: Welcome Back

What with the earthquakes occurring in the social media space, quite a
few folks are reemerging in the blogosphere. Glad to see these
gentlemen _(hmmm?)_  routinely pop up again in my feed reader:

* Garret Vreeland, [Dangerousmeta!][1]
* Matt Haughey, [A Whole Lotta Nothing][2]
* Greg Linden, [Geeking with Greg][5]
* Michael Sippey, [this is sippey’s blog][6]

Also have to mention [the return of Jason Kottke][4], [kottke.org][3],
who oddly enough I hadn’t ever really cottoned to not being so much
into popular culture items. But I’m getting interested in linkblogging
and he has always been the epitome of fine linkblogging.
