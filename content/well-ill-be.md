Over **seven** years ago, I [declared victory][1] on building a [processing][2] style framework in Python. Named it *peyote*. I even created [a GitHub repository for peyote][3].

Damn if 2 out of 3 example sketches I wrote for peyote don’t still work in Python 2.7 using current versions of modules such as [pygame][5] and [pycairo][4]. One sketch seems to have suffered from bitrot relative to the numpy module. This seems relatively surmountable though.

Well if this code can survive seven years of neglect, it probably deserves for me to resurrect it with some modern Python tooling and my improved development skills. Maybe even throw in some Python 3 compatibility.

*Viva El Peyote!*
