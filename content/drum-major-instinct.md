I'm Black or African-American if you prefer. In the United States, we have a federal holiday for [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.][3] who was instrumental in the American Civil Rights movement, which led to many of the liberties that I personally enjoyed this very day. I typically haven't mentioned it when I'm blogging, but his holiday is an important day in my book.

I was all set to post about the copious first world, 1%er, global elite, advantages that have been available to me thanks to Dr. King's effort *(along with a whole bunch of other people, including my parents)*. Heck, when I was born, a black President of the United States was unthinkable. There's a lot wrong with the US of A, but we've come a long way, and lit quite a path for other nations, even in my short existence.

Then [Hendrik Hertzberg's excellent, in-depth post][2] on the inaccuracy of the quote inscribed on the King monument came across my feed. Even Hertzberg's little taste of King's sermon to Ebenezer Baptist Church, the [*Drum Major Instinct*][4] sermon, set me straight:
> *The drum major instinct is real. **(Yes!)** And you know what else it causes to happen? It often causes us to live above our means. **(Make it plain!)** It’s nothing but the drum major instinct. Do you ever see people buy cars that they can’t even begin to buy in terms of their income? **(Amen!) [laughter]** You’ve seen people riding around in Cadillacs and Chryslers who don’t earn enough to have a good T-Model Ford. **(Make it plain!)** But it feeds a repressed ego. …*

> *The drum major instinct can lead to exclusivism in one's thinking and can lead one to feel that because he has some training, he's a little better than that person who doesn't have it. Or because he has some economic security, that he's a little better than that person who doesn't have it. And that's the uncontrolled, perverted use of the drum major instinct.*

Those snippets can't do [the whole 5000 words][4] justice, so make sure to read it yourself. But suffice it to say, while I am very thankful for all I have, and all those who sacrificed before me, I need to stay humble and think of ways I can personally do justice to the conclusion of his sermon.
