A bit dated, but hopefully not completely useless:

* After a stupefyingly long lag, [I’m](http://github.com/crossjam) actually [an open source contributor once again][1].

* 6 years of [happy MacBook ownership][2] in the books. Ye Old MacBook is still serving me well, although I think one of those new fangled Airs may be in the offing. Then again, that’s what I said about this time two years ago.

* And 6 years since [the first post][3] on this here blog. It’s been over 10 years total since [I began penning dispatches][4] on the Web.
