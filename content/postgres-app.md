Link parkin’: Heroku’s nicely packaged for Mac OS X, [Postgres.app][1]
> Postgres.app is the easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac. Open the app, and you have a PostgreSQL server ready and awaiting new connections. Close the app, and the server shuts down.

> Postgres.app will be distributed through the Mac App Store, with a separate build containing the latest PostgreSQL beta available for direct download from the website.
