My [first post about Flickr](http://crossjam.net/nmh/archives/000559.html#000559) was relatively early in its history. However, I never really got deep into Flickr but did [study tagging behavior](http://www.semanticmetadata.net/hosted/taggingws-www2006-files/3.pdf) a little bit. For 2009, one of my goals is to get back into the API, do some interesting empirical study, and create some generative art from publicly available photos.
