[Sean J. Taylor][2] interned with the LinkedIn Data Science team and had some cogent observations on what the work can really boil down to:

> Most people who describe data science are actually describing what it takes to get the job. (e.g. Take statistics and machine learning courses. Learn such-and-such languages/packages. Hack.). Or they describe how the job is growing in importance. I'm going to describe the actual practice of data science.

> [The Data Science Loop][1]:

> * Ask a good question.

> * Answer the question while economizing on resources.

> * Communicate your results.

> * (Sometimes) Make recommendations to engineers or managers.

The whole thing is worth a read, but most importantly, the closing graf.
