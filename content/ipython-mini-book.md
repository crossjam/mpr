Will definitely have to shell out for [Cyrille Rossant’s][2] [*Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization*][1]
> This book is a beginner-level introduction to IPython for interactive Python programming, high-performance numerical computing, and data visualization. It assumes nothing more than familiarity with Python. It targets developers, students, teachers, hobbyists who know Python a bit, and who want to learn IPython for the extended console, the Notebook, and for more advanced scientific applications.

Too much good e-book tech material at a good price these days.
