I’m on record as being [a Gibson fanboy][4] and a completist for all of his fiction, to the best of my knowledge. Yet *Distrust That Particular Flavor* had been sitting on my virtual ToRead pile for quite a long time.

The book is a collection of articles, book introductions, and speeches by Gibson, across a variety of venues: Wired, The New York Times, Time, Book Expo America, etc. As a former Wired subscriber, I was familiar with his style of journalism and had already read many of the articles, admittedly quite a while ago. Gibson self-acknowledges that he’s not really a journalist and is in fact not quite comfortable writing non-fiction. Thus, these snippets are truly of a distinctive flavor. 

Overall, these are mostly interesting just as a time capsule of technological and cultural shifts, the most recent dated from the year 2006. Anybody remember AltaVista? There are a couple of standouts like *The Road to Oceania* but nothing earth shattering.

The collection also provides some insights into Gibson’s thinking as particular novels developed. *William Gibson’s Filmless Festival* is a useful precursor to [*Pattern Recognition*][2]. 

Ultimately, *Distrust That Particular Flavor* is worthwhile if one is deep into [@GreatDismal][3], Gibson’s handle for his prolific Twitter output. If not, no worries if you skip it.
