I have a wealth of starred items stashed away in my feedreaders,
plural. Link parkin’ a few things of note. Only goal is to send you
off to some pieces loosely joined. Not too much thought put into it.

Recently learned about [reader][1], a minimalist Python module for
managing collections of RSS (and other) feeds.

Mark Litwintschik does his usual thorough data spelunking against [The
Streets of Monaco][2]

Simon Willison was [a guest on _architecture notes_][3] providing a great
overview of [datasette][4]

Matt Webb talks about his [blog writing approach][5]. I use
[Feedbin][6] much the same way [he does][7]. _I wonder how many feeds
I’m subscribed to?_
