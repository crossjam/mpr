Some folks at work were waxing ecstatic about how a [Pi-hole][1]
made such a huge difference in ad blocking. I thought installation
would be a little bit more effort than value for my time. Then I found
a small window of free time this weekend and thought "what the heck,
let’s give it a shot."

Commonly affiliated with Raspberry Pi devices, Pi-hole is actually
quite easy to deploy on an Ubuntu device. After less than an hours
worth of work, I had the whole stack up and running. And boy does it
make a difference! The screen cap below highlights the amount of ad
blockage for just a couple of hours and a few devices.

Sorry I waited so long!
