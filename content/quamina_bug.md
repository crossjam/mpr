Title: A Quamina Bug
Date: 2022-12-22
Status: published

Have to take a moment to acknowledge doing my duty as a good open
source citizen. Hey it was only [reporting a tiny bug][1] (_bug: Quote
escaping termination failure_) in Tim Bray’s [Quamina][2] library,
but every little bit counts. Also gave me a good opportunity to limber
up my issue reporting muscles.
