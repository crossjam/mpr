Here's the contents:

* *Introduction* (L. Sprague de Camp)

* *Letter from Robert E. Howard to P. Schuyler Miller* (Robert E. Howard)

* *The Hyborian Age, Part 1* (Robert E. Howard)

* *The Thing in the Crypt* (L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter)

* *The Tower of the Elephant* (Robert E. Howard)

* *The Hall of the Dead* (Robert E. Howard and L. Sprague de Camp)

* *The God in the Bowl* (Robert E. Howard)

* *Rogues in the House* (Robert E. Howard)

* *The Hand of Nergal* (Robert E. Howard and Lin Carter)

* *The City of Skulls* (L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter)

I cheated a little in that I didn't bother to read the *Introduction*, *Letter from Robert E. Howard to P. Schuyler Miller*, and *The Hyborian Age, Part 1*. Sorry if I remember the material wrong, but I wasn't interested in reading extensive world building and fanboyish claptrap.

In this series of stories, Conan is pretty young, basically a teenager. He wanders away from Cimmeria into the more "civilized" western nations of the area. Most of his initial adventures are as a thief, but by the end of the book he's become a trained mercenary. Interestingly in the first two-thirds of the book, the stories read with much more of a mystery feel than swords and sorcery.

As one can see, this is again a mix of Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. The straight Howard stuff is pure gold. *The Tower of the Elephant*, *The God in the Bowl*, and *Rogues in the House* are all well paced and written, if occasionally a bit flowery, reflecting the pulp heritage of the era. Special nod to *Rogues in the House* for inspiring the classic cover art by [Frank Frazetta][3]. Carter didn't do too bad a job finishing up *The Hand of Nergal*. The other three stories are pretty pedestrian. At the moment, I can't even remember the plot of *The Hall of the Dead*.

And just an observation, but I'm pretty sure every story up until *The City of Skulls* featured some form of the phrase, "Conan, naked but for a loincloth..." C'mon guys, break out a thesaurus once in a while.
