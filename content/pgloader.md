TIL [pgloader][1]

> pgloader has two modes of operation. It can either load data from
> files, such as CSV or Fixed-File Format; or migrate a whole database
> to PostgreSQL.

> pgloader supports several RDBMS solutions as a migration source, and
> fetches information from the catalog tables over a connection to
> then create an equivalent schema in PostgreSQL. This means that you
> can migrate to PostgreSQL in a single command-line!
