While I couldn't follow as closely as I would have liked over the winter, I've gotten back into it over the last few weeks. And the race has certainly become compelling!

As of a month or so ago, [Chelsea][3], the previous champion, looked dead. Despite starting off the campaign on fire, the Blues had fallen well behind [Manchester United][5]. Apparently they had a serious mid-season swoon. Similarly, my rooting choice, [Arsenal's Gunners][4], sort of flamed out, showing a little too much youth. Plus they got jobbed in the Liverpool match.

Meanwhile, Chelsea had awoken and closed to within 6 points of ManU to start this weekend. The Blues got a bunch of breaks (a.k.a dubious calls) in their match against Tottenham Hotspur and eked out a win. On the other hand, Arsenal rose up and knocked off Man U at home. Chelsea closes to 3 points and plays at Man U next Sunday. *Good stuff!!*

Not to mention the [UEFA Champions League][6] semi-finals conclude this week. One thing I didn't realize about top flight football in Europe is that the major powers are all playing multiple competitions simultaneously. Makes for more big matches.
