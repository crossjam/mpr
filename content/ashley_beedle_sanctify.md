<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

While [Black Science Orchestra][3] has a short discography, they will
always be remembered for the classic _New Jersey Deep_, which never
even got its own release, but was a b-side track on [_The Altered
States E. P._][1]

World could definitely use some more Black Science Orchestra.
