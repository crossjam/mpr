The way Movable Type handles [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting on posts with body and extended parts. The Markdown from the body part doesn't carry over to the extended part.

How [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) doesn't do well with re-editing of posts. I too often wind up with extra copies on the server.

How the [MarsEdit]((http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) post preview window doesn't display the destination of HTML links. Many of my posting errors involve incorrect links that could have easily been caught before posting.
