LDA stands for [Latent Dirichlet Allocation][2], a machine learning approach to extracting hidden structure from document collections. I’ve been touting and applying LDA at work for a while now and think I have a pretty good handle on it. However, it’s always good to review the understanding.  Edwin Chen has [a nice, approachable introduction to LDA][1] with a worked out example as the highlight. Thanks Edwin!
