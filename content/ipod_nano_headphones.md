Dorky looking but with great sound for the type of music I listen to.

In keeping with the sleekness of the new iPod Nano, I thought I'd give these newfangled in-ear headphones a shot. I bought the low end [Sennheiser headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-CX300-B-Earbuds-Black/dp/B000E6G9RI/) you see there on the right. I gave 'em a bit of a whirl for most of the day and it's going to take some getting used to. The sound is actually pretty decent, often equivalent to my Koss set. However, my ears always feel really weird, and the cords often transmit noise when I move vigorously. Plus, I tend to generate a lot of ear wax so the earcaps look a little scungy. Maybe I need to try one of the other size caps that came with the headphones.

In any event, I'll keep the test drive going, but I may have to retire the in-ears to the office.
