As someone who wrote a dissertation on programming language design, it’s rare when I see an announcement for a new language and go “Wow! That looks cool!” I just did that for the first time in a long time when I read about [eero][1]
> Eero is a fully binary- and header-compatible dialect of Objective-C, implemented with a modified version of the Apple-sponsored LLVM/clang open-source compiler. It features a streamlined syntax, Python-like indentation, and other features that improve readability and code safety. It is inspired by languages such as Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby.

> "Eero" is pronounced [ˈe-rō]‚ and is similar to the English word "aero".

After a surface read, I actually thought programming for the Mac OS X and/or iOS system APIs might be fun.

Still a long slog to success and popularity, but a kid’s gotta start somewhere.
