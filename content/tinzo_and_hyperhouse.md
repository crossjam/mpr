I’ve had a recent bout of chasing suggestions in Apple Music DJ Mix
compilations. Basically following some of those "You Might Also Like"
connections at the bottom of playlists. Two new artist discoveries are
[Tinzo][5] and [Anna Lunoe][6].

Tinzo has an attractive list of [compilations][1], which I landed on
through her [Jazzy House Mix][2]. It was as advertised a well done mix
of jazz flavored house cuts. Definitely off my beaten path but
multiple head nodding tracks, especially _Feels Good (Yeah) \[Kelly
G. Little Louie Parti Mix\]_.

> Siblings Tinzo and Jojo are the co-founders and resident DJs behind
> the New York based YouTube channel and party, Book Club Radio. 

> As a Queer Filipino-American, Tinzo’s music is rooted in the
> LGBTQIA+ experience, with inspiration drawn from house, jazz, and
> trance. With a diverse skill set in performance, digital marketing,
> and event production, Tinzo is dedicated to promoting unapologetic
> joy and inclusivity within the music and live events industry. 

[HYPERHOUSE Radio][3] is an Apple Music residency for [Anna
Lunoe][6]. According to Wikipedia, she was in on the ground floor of
Apple Music!

> Hosted by magnetic tastemaker and underground-club killer Anna
> Lunoe, Season 3 of HYPERHOUSE is all about the Sydney-born DJ’s
> prowess. Twice a month on Apple Music 1, Lunoe will share a
> 60-minute mix exploring the best in new dance and electronic music. 

[HYPERHOUSE: Episode 72][4] was just refreshingly new to me. Didn’t
feature anyone I was really aware of other than TSHA (_gooddess_).

Between these two series and [Beats in Space][7], there is an endless
trove of DJ mixes to consume on Apple Music.
