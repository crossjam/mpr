I've seen the logo in a number of pop culture appearances. I might argue that it's surpassed the Batman and Superman logos for social currency.Makes for a damn nice t-shirt. And as my OS X logon image, the operating system automatically adds some nice shiny highlights that make it look even better. 

Too bad it's tied to one of the dopiest characters in the DC universe. I mean c'mon, a guy who creates randomly convenient physical manifestations sheerly by willpower? You've got to be joking. Oh yeah, doesn't work against the color yellow.
