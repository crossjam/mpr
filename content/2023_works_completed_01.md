Title: Works Completed in 2023, Part 1

It’s been a while for one of these. I’m switching to "Works"
completed (as opposed to "Books"), to cover a broader range of cultural
material I’ve engaged with. I’m not going all ["media diet"][1] like
Jason Kottke, _(especially not grading)_ but I find myself expanding
beyond books quite a bit this year. Also, I can park some sport stuff
here as well if necessary.

These are episodes of note. I subscribe to a lot of podcasts, receive
a ton of episodes, listen to a subset, and find a few that are
remarkable.
