Title: 100 Days of Fabric

Maybe in 2025 I should do a _100 Days of Fabric_ post series. The idea
would be to listen at least once to every mix from [my collection of
the Fabric series][1]. Stretch goal would be to run these listens
consecutively as a streak. Hard but doable.

From the data side, it would be a nice side quest to auto generate the
skeleton of each post from the [Discogs Data Dumps][2]
