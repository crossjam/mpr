Title: 100 Days of Fabric

Maybe later this year I should do a _100 Days of Fabric_ blog
series. The idea would be to listen at least once to every mix from
[my collection of the Fabric series][1] and post about it. Stretch
goal would be to run these listens consecutively as a streak. Hard but
doable.

From the data side, it would be a nice side quest to auto generate the
skeleton of each post from the [Discogs Data Dumps][2]. Work with AI
to develop the code including the embedding and styling for
track lists. Maybe throw in an LLM generated summary and related artists
section.

Another side quest would be to develop an app that could serve oEmbed
content for track listings from slices of the Discogs Dataset.
