I really enjoyed Ted Leung's [recap][1] of the [Surge 2011][2] conference. I don't know squat about scalability matters, the purview of the [DevOps][3] community, but there was one quote from Leung's recap that really struck me:
> *specialization is an industrial age notion and needs to be discounted in spaces where we operate at the boundary of the known versus unknown.*

This was from Ben Fried, Google's CIO, commenting on how his organization's structure failed to solve a problem with a very complex system. Turns out no one could really understand the system from a global, end-to-end perspective, which was the key to solving the problem.

The quote really resonated, because on the day job I've been working on a team trying to strategically address a particularly thorny innovation challenge. Many of the technology components are known, and pairwise compositions well understood. But the unknown solution feels like it needs to emerge from a global, end-to-end perspective. If you agree with Fried, and I think I do, we'll need some generalists to rise to the task.

And of course our company is chock full of stovepiped specialists.
