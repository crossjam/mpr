After Kansas, Georgetown, and Villanova wrecked any chance of winning my bracket pool, I was hoping to get some karma back on Cal and Maryland. Cal just got overpowered by Duke. The Blue Devils were a better team on just about every measure. Their size and their defense pretty much smothered Cal's hopes in a **brutally** efficient fashion.

I give Maryland, in general, and Greivis Vasquez, in particular, a lot of credit for coming back to take the lead *(twice)* in the final seconds. Sparty just made one more big, **brutal**, heartbreaking shot.

**N.b.** None of the teams mentioned above had "one-and-dones". All four had senior leadership and returning tourney experience. Didn't make much of a difference in Cal-Duke, but I thought the level of play was excellent in the Maryland-Michigan State game.

Looks like I may have to resort to rooting for Washington in the hopes that they knock off Kentucky.
