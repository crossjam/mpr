Link parkin’. A couple of other static site generation engines:

* [Nikola][1]
* [Hugo][2]

I’m probably hobbling [Pelican][3] by running page generation on a
2008 White plastic MacBook (!!), but it feels pokey to me. And it
always seems to regen from all my source pages, including a ton that
haven’t changed in years. Whatever algorithm is being used for change
detection doesn’t seem to be working. Now lining up alternatives to explore.
