Interesting post by Sean Gorman of [GeoIQ][4], on [“Just in Time Analytics” a.k.a. *kanban* analyses][1], especially in the context of Big Data:
> *The presentation was on the concept of how analysis can evolve to better take advantage of real time data streams. The community currently does lots of fascinating analysis of real time data from Twitter, mobiles devices, sensors etc., but it is inevitably a post mortem. By that I mean we do the analysis well after the event itself is over. If we think of a data stream as a living organism that is constantly changing we focus our analysis on the history that has already past.*

The post summarizes a [presentation][3] *(which I need to partake of)* at the [O’Reilly Where 2012 conference][2].
