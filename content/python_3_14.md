[Python 3.14][2] got released recently. The team at Astral has [a good
feature overview][1] amongst the many floating around on the ’Net. The
overview is admittedly tinged with a focus on [uv][4] and [ruff][3],
so getting a few differing takes is a good idea. There’s nothing in
this particular Python release I’m in a rush to try out, but the
progress on exploiting processor concurrency is heartening.
