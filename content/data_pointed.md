Picked this up [from O'Reilly Radar][1]. Steve von Worley's [Data Pointed][2] looks like an interesting [take on data science][3]:

> *The Data Pointed recipe? One part magazine, with original, longer-format articles that document our in-house research endeavors, and two parts blog, chronicling interesting developments from elsewhere within the field of data art and visualization. Combine, add a pinch of comedy and half a thesaurus, pressure cook until tender, and bon appétit! To receive updates fresh-and-hot, please do subscribe to the RSS feed, follow on Twitter, or fan on Facebook.*
